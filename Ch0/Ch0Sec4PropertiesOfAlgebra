{topic}{1} REPLACING VARIABLES WITH NUMBERS
  If all the variables in an algebraic expression is assigned to a number, then we can replace the variable in the expression, and then evaluate it using the {tag 0.3.1}Order of Operations{\tag}
  Putting the replaced variable within parenthesis is a good habit, to avoid mistakes later

{def}{2}
  {Like Terms} Terms of an algebraic expression where the variables match exactly (exponents included), where the only difference is in the {tag mod}constants{\tag}. Like terms in a given algebraic expression can be {tag 0.4.3}combined{\tag} to simplify the expression
{\def}
{topic}{3} COMBINING LIKE TERMS
  If an algebraic expression has two or more {tag 0.4.2}like terms{\tag}, they can be combined by {tag 0.1.2}adding{\tag}/{tag 0.1.3}subtracting{\tag} the constants and keeping the variables the same

{def}{4}
  {Distributive Property} a(b+c) = ab + ac
{\def}
{topic}{5} DISTRIBUTION
  When there are parenthesis in an algebraic expression, we can often get rid of those parenthesis using the {tag 0.4.4}distributive property{\tag}. Using this, you can multiply each of the terms within the parenthesis with the number in front of the parenthesis.
  You can distribute a negative sign around a parenthesis, just as you would as if you were multiplying by -1
