{tpc}[1][Replacing Variables with Numbers]
  If all the variables in an algebraic expression is assigned to a number, then we can replace the variable in the expression, and then evaluate it using the {tag ..}Order of Operations{\tag}
  Putting the replaced variable within parenthesis is a good habit, to avoid mistakes later

{def}[2][Like Terms]
  Terms of an algebraic expression where the variables match exactly (exponents included) are called like terms, where the only difference is in the {tag ..}constants{\tag}. Like terms in a given algebraic expression can be {tag ..}combined{\tag} to simplify the expression

{\def}
{topic}[3][Combining Like Terms]
  If an algebraic expression has two or more {tag ..}like terms{\tag}, they can be combined by {tag ..}adding{\tag}/{tag ..}subtracting{\tag} the constants and keeping the variables the same

{def}[4][Distributive Property]
  $a(b+c) = ab + ac$
{\def}
{topic}[5][Distribution]
  When there are parenthesis in an algebraic expression, we can often get rid of those parenthesis using the {tag ..}distributive property{\tag}. Using this, you can multiply each of the terms within the parenthesis with the number in front of the parenthesis.
  You can distribute a negative sign around a parenthesis, just as you would as if you were multiplying by -1
