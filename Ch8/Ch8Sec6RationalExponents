[Chapter 8] Radicals
[Section 6] Rational Exponents

{tpc}[1][Radicals as Exponents]
  Any {tag ..}radical{\tag} can be written as an exponent.
  A square root of an expression is just that expression to the $\frac{1}{2}$ power
  A cube root of an expression is just that expression to the $\frac{1}{3}$ power
  In general /* formula: nth root of a = a ^ 1/n */
  {exp}{\exp}
  This can be combined with other exponents as well.
  In general /* include full formula */
  {exp}{\exp}
  Why is this important?
  We now know that in {tag ..}order of operations{\tag}, exponents and radicals are in the same step. Recall the {tag ..}properties of exponents{\tag}, which can now be used for both exponents and radicals
  In many cases, we can rewrite a radical as exponents to make it easier to solve
  {exp}{\exp}
  Solving problems, such as {tag ..}rationalizing the denominator{\tag} become much more intuitive when using exponents as opposed to radicals. Simply find which exponents add to one and multiply the numerator and denominator by the expression to that power
  Be sure you are comfortable with {tag ..}the rules of exponents{\tag} when using radicals as exponents. This will be very helpful and important in this section.
