{3} ADDING RADICALS

{topic}{1} Adding and Subtracting Radicals
  Adding and Subtracting radicals is very similar to {tag ..}adding and subtracting terms with variables{\tag}.
  If we treat a {tag ..}radical{\tag} as a {tag ..}variable{\tag}, we can combine as if we were {tag ..}combining like terms{\tag}, by simply factoring out the radical and simplifying
  {ex}{\ex}
  Note that the numbers under the radical, as well as the degree of the radical must be identical if we are to use this method. Once they are different, we can no longer simplify.
  Always simplify each radical first, as this will make sure you match all the radicals when necessary.
