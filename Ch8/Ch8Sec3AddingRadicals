[Chapter 8] Radicals
[Section 3] Adding Radicals

{tpc}[1][Adding and Subtracting Radicals]

  We can add and subtract radicals that have the same base. We just simply have to take the expression under the radical and keep the base.
  In more mathematical terms, this is written as $\sqrt[n]{a} \pm \sqrt[n]{b} = \sqrt[n]{a \pm b}$.

  Note that the numbers under the radical, as well as the degree of the radical must be identical if we are to use this method. Once they are different, we can no longer simplify.
  Always simplify each radical first, as this will make sure you match all the radicals when necessary.
