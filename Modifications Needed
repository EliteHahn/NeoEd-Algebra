---------------
General Changes
---------------
  * Allow hard vs soft tags
  * Allow toggling of tags
  * Deeper understanding tag/section, where we have in depth discussions about how to do this shit

---------------
Arithmetic Tags
---------------
  * Reciprocal
  * Least Common Denominator
  * Greatest Common Denominator
  * Numerator
  * Denominator
  * Constant
  * Operation

-----------------
Chapter 0 Changes
-----------------
  * In section 2, we need a way to talk about how to get fractions to get the same denominator, using an LCD

-----------------
Chapter 3 Changes
-----------------
  * Section 1, we talk about graphing inequalities as if they were equalities. However, these are different things (1D vs 2D), and should probably be notated/tagged differently

-----------------
Chapter 4 Changes
-----------------
  * I think we can change the way Systems of equations is represented. I'm gonna write something up and then we'll see how it goes.


-----------------
Chapter 5 Changes
-----------------
  * 3(x + 4)(x -6) we need a common error thing to show we cannot distribute 3 to all of them, and rather than just 1
  * Do we have anything about (a + b)^2 != a^2 + b^2?

-----------------
Chapter 6 Changes
-----------------
  * The definition of "Factoring" is a bit incomplete. I believe we have defined this somewhere else, but we need to unify and fix this
  * 6-2 needs work, this is a difficult topic
  * 6-3 may need a better example dealing with negatives.
  * 6-4 we need better letters lmao
  * 6-5 we need a topic about x^4 - y^4 and other even powers somewhere in this book.
  * 6-5 Special products, we need a better way to organize cubes and shit
  * 6-6 I don't think we need this section. But we'll see in Organization Draft

-----------------
Chapter 8 Changes
-----------------
  * 8-1 We say "square factor", no idea what that means. Oh wait, yes I do, but it's confusing
  * Chapter 8 sucks, fix it
  * 8-3 Abstract -> Concrete vs Concrete -> Abstract. Treating a number as a variable is actually only for math kids. Everyone else apparently has trouble with this.
  * We need to constantly specify that a RADICAL IS AN EXPONENT
