{def}[1][Product Rule of Exponents]
  $a^ma^n = a^{m+n}$
  In this case, a can represent anything. It can be a variable, a number, an imaginary number.
  {exp}{\exp}
  This property can be used to simplify exponents
{\def}
{def}[2][Quotient Rule of Exponents]
  $\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}$
  In this case, a can represent anything. It can be a variable, a number, an imaginary number.
  {exp}{\exp}
  This property can be used to simplify exponents
{\def}
{def}[2][Power of a Power Rule of Exponents]
  $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$
  In this case, a can represent anything. It can be a variable, a number, an imaginary number
  {exp}{\exp}
  This property can be used to simplify exponents
{\def}
{def}[4][Power of a Product Rule of Exponents]
  $(ab)^m = a^mb^m$
  In this case, a and b can represent anything. They can be variables, numbers, imaginary numbers
  {exp}{\exp}
{\def}
/* We need a common error tag for (a+b)^n != a^n + b^n*/
{def}[5][Power of a Quotient Rule of Exponents]
  $(\frac{a}{b})^m = \frac{a^m}{b^m}$
  In this case, a and b can represent anything. They can be variables, numbers, imaginary numbers

{tpc}[5][Simplifying Problems with Exponents]
  Many times, the five properties, {tag ..}product rule of exponents $(a^ma^n=a^{m+n})${\tag}, {tag ..}quotient rule of exponents ($\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n}{\tag}$), {tag ..}power of a Power Rule of Exponents $((a^m)^n=a^{mn}{\tag})$, {tag ..}Power of a Product Rule of Exponents$((ab)^m = a^mb^m)${\tag}, and {tag ..}Power of a Quotient Rule of Exponents $((\frac{a}{b})^m = \frac{a^m}{b^m})${\tag} are often found in the same question
  Although there is a little bit of flexibility as to which property is used first, {tag ..}order of operations{\tag} still applies to a problem. Simplifying within a parenthesis, then power rules, then product and quotient rules is a safe way to not make errors
  Many times, there will be multiple ways to simplify an exponent problem, but at each step, you should aim to simplify the problem carefully, without making mistakes and without losing track of variables or exponents
