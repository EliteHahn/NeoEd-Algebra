[Section 2] Negative Exponents

{def}[1][Zero Power Rule of Exponents]
  $a^0 = 1$, for any $a$
  $a$ can be a number, a variable does not matter

{\def}
{def}[2][Rules of Negative Exponents]
  $a^{-m} = \frac{1}{a^m}$
  Equivalently, we can rewrite this as
  $\frac{1}{a^{-m}} = a^m$
  In english, this means that anything to a negative exponent ($a^{-m}$) is just equal to 1 over that number to the same positive exponent.
  For fractions to negative exponents, we can flip the {tag ..}numerator{\tag} and {tag ..}denominator{\tag}
  $(\frac{a}{b})^{-m} = (\frac{b}{a})^m = \frac{b^m}{a^m} = frac{a^{-m}}{b^{-m}}$
  {exp}{\exp}
  Notice how $a^{-1}$ is just the {tag ..}reciprocal{\tag} of that number!

{tpc}[3][Simplifying Negative Exponents by Removing Negative Exponents]
  Negative exponents can be removed in several different ways. If a question asks you to take an expression and change it so that it doesn't have any negative exponents, we need to learn an easy way to do this
  If we want to get rid of negative exponents in an expression, we can think of our expression as a fraction
  Negative exponents in the numerator must be moved to the denominator.
  Likewise, negative exponents in the denominator need to be moved to the numerator.
  When the base with the negative exponent moves, the exponent becomes positive. This is because of the {tag ..}rules of exponents{\tag}: Flipping the sign of the exponent is the same as moving the base from the numerator to the denominator, or vice versa.

  Once this is done, you can {tag ..}simplify just as you would with positive exponents{\tag}

{tpc}[4][Moving Everything to the Numerator]
  There may be times when a question asks you to move all terms to the numerator, essentially getting rid of the denominator.
  In this case, flip the signs of all exponents in the denominator, and move them to the numerator.
