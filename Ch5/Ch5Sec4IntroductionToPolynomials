{4} INTRODUCTION TO POLYNOMIALS

{def}{1}
  {Terms} A product of numbers and/or variables
  {ex}{\ex}
  {nex}{\nex}
  Expressions are often {tag ..}named based on the number of terms in them{\tag}, for example, a monomial has one term, a binomial has 2 terms, and a polynomial has many terms. All of these fall into the category of {tag ..}polynomials{\tag}
{\def}

{topic}{2} Names of polynomials
  {tag ..}Polynomials{\tag} are named based on the number of {tag ..}terms{\tag} they have. Here are a few of the common names of {tag ..}polynomimals{\tag} that you will see
  Monomials have one {tag ..}term{\tag}
  {ex}{\ex}
  Binomial have two {tag ..}terms{\tag}
  {ex}{\ex}
  Trinomials have three {tag ..}terms{\tag}
  {ex}{\ex}
  Polynomials have many {tag ..}terms{\tag}
  {ex}{\ex}

{def}{3}
  {Polynomial} Polynomials are a group of 1 or more terms, separated by addition or subtraction
  {ex}{\ex}
{\def}

{topic}{4} Evaluating Polynomials
  Given a {tag ..}polynomial{\tag} with variables, you can {tag ..}evaluate the polynomials as long as you know the values of the variables{\tag}
  {ex}{\ex}
  It is important to be careful with {tag ..}negative variables with even exponents{\tag}. This means that -x^2 can be a different solution from (-x)^2, so you need to be careful of what you are dealing with

{topic}{5} Negative Numbers with exponent vs Negative Numbers with Exponents
  Because of {tag ..}order of operations{\tag}, it matters whether or not the negative sign is being raised to the exponent
  This is because, with even exponenets, negative numbers may become positive.
  Consider the following examples and their contrasts
  {ex}{\ex}
  Notice how when the negative is in parenthesis, it is also being raised to the power, but when it is on the outside, {tag..}order of operations{\tag} denotes that the number is squared, and then negated.

{topic}{6} Simplifying Polynomials
  Often times, we will not know the value of the variables in a polynomial, so instead, the only way to simplify the polynomial is to {tag..}combine like terms{\tag}
  {ex}{\ex}
  Once all the terms are combined, the polynomial is simplified
{\topic}

{topic}{7} Adding and Subtracting Polynomials
  Adding Polynomials is as simple as {tag ..} combining like terms{\tag}.
  {ex}{\ex}
  Subtracting polynomials is almost as simple.
  The one extra step is to {tag ..}distribute the negative sign{\tag} to all terms in the polynomial that is being subtracted, and then {tag ..}combining like terms to simplify{\tag}
