[Section 5] Multiplying Polynomials

{tpc}[1][Multiplying Monomials]
  Multiplying {tag ..}monomials{\tag} is a concept that is needed for multiplying polynomials
  The process is very simple. Just multiply together the coefficients, and multiply the variables using {tag ..}exponent rules{\tag}.
  After multiplying monomials, you should have each variable listed at most 1 time for it to be simplified.
  {exp}{\exp}
  {nex}{\nex}

{topic}[2][Multiplying Monomials by Polynomials]
  Multiplying monomials by Polynomials is an important concept to understand for when we are multiplying polynomials
  The process is simple: simply {tag ..}distribute the monomial through the parenthesis using the distributive property{\tag}
  {exp}{\exp}
  Then, since now we have multiple products of monomials, {tag ..}multiply each of the the monomials{\tag} to get your final answer. You should end up with the same number of {tag ..}terms{\tag} as you did in your original polynomial.

{tpc}[3][Multiplying Polynomials through Distribution]
  Distribution is one of the several ways to multiply polynomials
  The advantage of using Distribution is that it can be used to multiply polynomials of any size
  Just like you can {tag ..}distribute a monomial through parenthesis{\tag}, we can distribute an entire polynomial as well
  As we do this, we take each term of the second polynomial and multiply it to the first polynomial.
  {exp}{\exp}
  After doing this step, recognize that you know have two different monomials multiplied to polynomials. {tag ..}Multiply those out{\tag}
  Essentially, you are doing multiple distributions to multiply polynomials. Because of this, this process can get pretty messy, so be sure to write clearly to avoid making mistakes.
  It is important to remember to {tag ..}keep the positive and negative signs while distributing{\tag}
  This process of distribution can also be reversed, in a very important process called {tag ..}factoring{\tag} which we will learn about at a later chapter.

{tpc}[4][Multiplying Binomials through FOIL]
  FOIL, or FOILing is a method of multiplying two {tag ..}binomials{\tag}, and is a special case of {tag ..} multiplying polynomials through distribution{\tag} that only works for {tag ..}binomials{\tag}
  FOIL stands for FIRST, OUTER, INNER, LAST, each of these words referring to parts of the two binomials
  FIRST refers to the first term in each binomial
  {exp}{\exp}
  OUTER refers to the outer two terms in the two binomials
  {exp}{\exp}
  INNER refers to the inner two terms in the two binomials
  {exp}{\exp}
  LAST refers to the last terms in each binomial
  {exp}{\exp}
  The FOIL method is when we {tag ..}multiply{\tag} the FIRST terms, the OUTER terms, the INNER terms, and LAST terms and combine them. Note that of each step of FOIL, we are simply {tag ..}multiplying monomials{\tag}
  {exp}
    /* Big examples of foil step by step, with four separate terms, and then combining them */
  {\exp}
  Don't forget to preserve negative signs when combining them
  Note how this process is the same as {tag ..}multiplying polynomials through distribution{\tag}
  {exp}
    /* Show the steps in a distributive way */
  {\exp}

{tpc}[5][Multiplying Polynomials in Rows]
  Multiplying numbers in rows is a process that is very similar to multiplying numbers.
  Because the process is so similar, it would be easiest to show these processes side by side rather than explain the individual steps
  The main idea is to think of each {tag ..}monomial{\tag} as a digit, and multiply as you would in long multiplication
  {exp}{\exp}
  Again, this process is advantageous since you can use it to multiply polynomials of all size
