{tpc}[1][Divide Polynomials by Monomials]
  The process of dividing Polynomials by Monomials is similar to {tag ..}distributing{\tag}, but instead of multiplying, we are dividing (remember that dividing is just multiplying by the reciprocal)
  We will divide each {tag ..}monomial{\tag} in the {tag ..}polynomial{\tag} in the numerator by the {tag ..}monomial{\tag} in the denominator
  {exp}{\exp}
  Remember, that when you have the same thing in the denominator and the numerator, it {tag ..}cancels out{\tag} to 1 (not 0)

  The process of dividing polynomials is very similar to long division. In order for this process to work however, we must first have all the terms in both polynomials in decreasing order. If you're missing a power, let's say $n$, you must add a $0x^n$ in your polynomials. Remember, that since the coefficient is zero, we're not actually adding anything. This is just so that this process is easier when we do the long division.

  So remember from earlier classes how you did long division. When you had two larger numbers and you wanted to divide them, it was difficult because unlike smaller problems, you could have no idea where to start. For example, if we wanted to do $5,356 \div 31$, we couldn't do this in our heads, since it is unlikely you know your 31 times tables.
  Instead, we used long division, which allowed us to break up the problem into smaller chunks, that we knew how to deal with. It is much easier to calculate $53 \div 31$ than it is to calculate $5,356 \div 31$. We only needed to look at the first few digits of the large number at a time to be able to do long division.
  Long division of polynomials is the same way. A problem like $(3x^3 + 17x^2 -3x + 110) \div (x + 5)$ is very difficult to do, unless we are able to break it down into small chunks and solve them individually, just like we did with long division of numbers. At any given time when dividing, we only have to look at the first terms of each polynomial.

  1. To start, write down the division as you would a long division problem. As we said before, make sure the polynomials aren't missing any powers and are in decreasing order
  2. Look at the first term of each polynomial. Divide the one in the numerator by the one in the denominator. Remember, since they are both monomials, all we are doing is {tag ..}dividing a monomial by a monomial{\tag}. You can ignore all the other terms for this step
  3. Once you have a result after you've divided the monomials, we want to repeat a process that we used with long division. Multiply this number with the {tag ..}denominator{\tag}. Subtract this number from the numerator, just as you did in long division. Remember, when subtracting a polynomial, to {tag ..}distribute the minus sign{\tag} to all the terms in the polynomial. It may even be easier to add the opposite of every term, if you prefer.
  4. After subtracting, you should end up with a new polynomial, this time, the highest degree should be one lower than what it was before. As you can see, we are slowly making this problem simpler. Repeat steps 2 through 4 using this new polynomial
  5. Eventually, you will reach a point where the denominator will not go into the numerator at all. This happens when the highest degree term of the denominator is higher than that of the numerator. Sometimes, when this number is 0, we are finished! Otherwise, when this happens, this final polynomial (or sometimes monomial) is your remainder. Your final answer is all the answers you got in step 2 combined, as well as your remainder (if you have one) divided by your denominator.

  In conclusion, the steps to dividing any two polynomials are:
  1. Make sure both the divisor and the dividend are in decreasing order. Make sure the degrees count down without skipping any. If any are skipped, add the degree onto the variable with a coefficient of zero.
  2. Divide the first term of the dividend by the first term of the divisor. Write this number at the top.
  3. Multiply the number you just wrote by the divisor. Subtract this number from the dividend. The first monomial should cancel. The resulting number is now your new divisor
  4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you cannot divide any further. You will know you have reached this point when the degree of your divisor is greater than the degree of your new dividend. When this happens, write the remainder as a fraction, by putting the remainder as the numerator and the divisor as the denominator.
