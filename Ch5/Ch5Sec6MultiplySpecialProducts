{6} MULTIPLY SPECIAL PRODUCTS

{topic}{1} Sum and Difference Special Product
  This method of multiplying polynomials works on a very situation of problems of the form (a + b)(a - b)
  a and b in this case can be numbers, variables, or anything else
  When multiplied out, the answer is in the form a^2 - b^2

  /* proof, explain how the middle term is subtracted out. Show that we could do this with distribution{tag} but it is much longer */
  Notice how when this is done with {tag ..}distribution{\tag}, we get the same result, it just takes many more steps
  Note that this is the same as the {tag ..} difference of two squares{\tag} method of factoring, in chapter 6
  It is very important that you memorize this form, as it will appear very often in mathematics and in this course

{topic}{2} Perfect Square Special Product
  Another method of multiplying polynomials works on binomials multiplied to itself.
  In other words, of the form (a+b)(a+b) or (a+b)^2
  This also works for (a -b)(a - b) or (a - b)^2
  (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
  (a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2
  Notice how these two are actually the same, except in (a-b)^2, we can think of it as (a + (-b))^2
  /* Fix this shitty explanation ^^^^^^ */

  /* Do a proof, just like the one above */
  A helpful tip, is that the middle term in the polynomial is the same as the sign before you multiply it out
  {ex}/*give a brief example showing this */{\ex}
  Notice how when this is done with {tag ..}distribution{\tag}, we get the same result, it just takes many more steps
  Note that this is the same as {tag ..}factoring a^2 + 2ab + b^2 {\tag} in chapter 6
  It is very important that you memorize this form, as it will appear very often in mathematics and in this course
