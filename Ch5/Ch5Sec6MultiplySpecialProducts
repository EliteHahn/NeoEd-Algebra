[Chapter 5] Polynomials
[Section 6] Multiply Special Products

{tpc}[1][Sum and Difference Special Product]
  This method of multiplying polynomials works on a very situation of problems of the form $(a + b)(a - b)$
  $a$ and $b$ in this case can be numbers, variables, or anything else
  When multiplied out, the answer is in the form $a^2 - b^2$
  {exp}{\exp}
  /* proof, explain how the middle term is subtracted out. Show that we could do this with distribution{tag} but it is much longer */
  Notice how when this is done with {tag ..}distribution{\tag}, we get the same result, it just takes many more steps
  Note that this is the same as the {tag ..} difference of two squares{\tag} method of factoring, in chapter 6
  It is very important that you memorize this form, as it will appear very often in mathematics and in this course

{tpc}[2][Perfect Square Special Product]
  Another method of multiplying polynomials works on binomials multiplied to itself.
  In other words, of the form $(a+b)(a+b)$ or $(a+b)^2$
  This also works for $(a -b)(a - b)$ or $(a - b)^2$
  $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$
  $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$
  Notice how these two are actually the same, except in $(a-b)^2$, we can think of it as $(a + (-b))^2$
  /* Fix this shitty explanation ^^^^^^ */
  {exp}{\exp}
  /* Do a proof, just like the one above */
  A helpful tip, is that the middle term in the polynomial is the same as the sign before you multiply it out
  {exp}/*give a brief example showing this */{\exp}
  Notice how when this is done with {tag ..}distribution{\tag}, we get the same result, it just takes many more steps
  Note that this is the same as {tag ..}factoring $a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ {\tag} in chapter 6
  It is very important that you memorize this form, as it will appear very often in mathematics and in this course
