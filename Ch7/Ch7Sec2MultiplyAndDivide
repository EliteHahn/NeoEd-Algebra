[Chapter 7] Rational Expressions
[Section 2] Multiply and Divide

{tpc}[1][Multiplying and Dividing Rational Expressions]
  The process for Multiplying and dividing rational expressions is very similar to the process used to {tag ..}multiply and divide fractions{\tag}
  To multiply, simply {tag ..}multiply{\tag} straight across the numerator and the denominator, and then {tag ..}simplify the rational{\tag}
  {exp}{\exp}
  The process for dividing is similar as well too. Simply {tag ..}take the reciprocal{\tag} of the second {tag ..}rational{\tag}, and multiply the two together (see above), and {tag ..}simplify{\tag}
  {exp}{\exp}
  Recall that when there are {tag ..}polynomials{\tag} with more than one term in the rational, you must factor before you can simplify in both multiplication and division. YOU CANNOT SIMPLIFY POLYNOMIALS BY CROSSING COMMON TERMS OUT
