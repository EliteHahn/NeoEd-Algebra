{tpc}[1][Solving Rational Equations]
  Whenever there is an equation that has {tag ..}rationals{\tag} in it, we can simplify the problem by multiplying all terms on both sides of the equation by the {tag ..}least common multiple{\tag} to get rid of the denominator
  After this, the problem can be solved, with one extra step: making sure none of the denominators are zero (since we cannot divide by zero). This means, that after we get our solutions, we must plug the solutions back into the original equation to make sure that the denominators of each side are not zero.

  Although the denominators of each term may be complex, the process is still the same.
  Remember to {tag ..}distribute the subtraction sign{\tag} as necessary!
  {exp}{\exp}
  Once we have possible solutions to the rational equation, we must then make sure none of the denominators evaluate to zero (otherwise, the solution we found will not be valid).
  Simply plug the values, one at a time, into the original equation, and if none of the denominators evaluate to zero, then we have a solution. Otherwise, that particular value is not a solution
