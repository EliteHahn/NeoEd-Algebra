{tpc}[1][Finding the Least Common Denominator of a Monomial]
  Finding the {tag ..}least common denominator{\tag} of a {tag ..}term{\tag} with {tag ..}variables{\tag} is very similar to the process of {tag ..}finding the least common denominator{\tag} of two numbers.
  When finding the {tag ..}least common denominator{\tag} or, {tag ..}LCD{\tag} of several monomials, we first find the {tag ..}LCD of the coefficients{\tag}, then use all variables and attach the highest exponent of each variable.

{tpc}[2][Finding the Least Common Denominator of a Polynomial]
  Finding the {tag ..}least common denominator{\tag} of a {tag ..}polynomial{\tag} is very similar to the process of {tag ..}finding the least common denominator of numbers{\tag} and of {tag ..}monomials{\tag}
  The difference is, we must {tag ..}factor the polynomial{\tag}, so that we can identify all the {tag ..}factors{\tag} we use, as well as any exponents we may attach to those {tag ..}factors{\tag}
  {exp}{\exp}
  After we factor, like before, the least common denominator of the polynomials is the product of any {tag ..}factors{\tag} we use, and attach their highest exponent in any of the {tag ..}polynomials{\tag}.

{tpc}[3][Getting the Denominators of Two Rationals To Match]
  In order to get the denominator of two rationals to match, we must first find the {tag ..}least common denominator{\tag} of the two denominators. Remember, there are different, but similar processes for finding the {tag ..}least common denominator{\tag}, {tag ..}one for monomials (one term, such as $xy^2$){\tag} and {tag ..}one for polynomials (many terms, such as $x^2 -2x + 5xy$){\tag}
  {exp}/* Getting the LCM */{\exp}
  Once the {tag ..}Least common denominator{\tag} is found, we must find out what factors each denominator is missing to get to that {tag ..}least common denominator{\tag}
  In other words, we must find the number we need to multiply each of the denominators with to get to the Least common denominator
  {exp}/* Finding which factors get you the LCM */{\exp}
  Once that term is found, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by that number to get us an equivalent fraction.
  The new denominator should evaluate to the LCD we calculated earlier.
  Doing this process with all the {tag ..}rationals{\tag} can give us multiple equivalent {tag ..}rationals{\tag} with a common denominator
  This of course means we can now {tag ..}add and subtract rationals{\tag}, which we will learn about in the next section.
