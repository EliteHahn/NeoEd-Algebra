{def}[1][Proportion]
  A proportion in it's most basic sense is two rationals that are equal to each other.
  We can also say that they are proportional to each other
  They are most useful for finding the {tag ..}cross product{\tag} to solve a proportion
  Proportions can mean many different things. If two rationals are equal, then that means they are equivalent fractions.
  This also means that two ratios are equivalent.

{tpc}[2][Finding the Cross Product]
  If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $ad = bc$
  {exp}/*Maybe a proof here or something idk */{\exp}
  The cross product essentially tells us we can multiply diagonally to get an equation with no fractions that we can solve
{\tpc}

{tpc}[3][Solving Proportions]
  In order to solve a {tag ..}proportion{\tag}, we must first {tag ..}find the cross product{\tag}
  While doing this, remember to {tag ..}distribute{\tag} the products when needed
  After finding the cross product, you will get a standard equation that can be solved. This can be {tag ..}linear{\tag}, or {tag ..}quadratic{\tag} in certain instances. Either way, solve as necessary for the variable
