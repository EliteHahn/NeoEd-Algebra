[Chapter 7] Rational Expressions
[Section 6] Proportions

{def}[1][Proportion]
  A proportion in it's most basic sense is two {tag ..}rational expressions{\tag} that are equal to each other.
  We can also say that they are proportional to each other
  {exp}{\exp}
  They are most useful for finding the {tag ..}cross product{\tag} to solve for a variable within a proportion. In otherwords, if two rationals are equal to each other, using the cross product, we can solve for a variable.
  {exp}{\exp}
  Proportions can mean many different things. If two rationals are equal, then that means they are equivalent fractions.
  This also means that the ratio of the two rationals are equivalent.
  This idea is very important in all fields. For example, if a recipe calls for 2 cups of sugar for 10 servings, we can deduce that we need 4 cups of sugar for 20 servings. These two ratios, $\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ servings}}$ and $\frac{4 \text{ cups}}{20 \text{ servings}}$ are equal and can be set as a proportion $\frac{2 \text{ cups}}{10 \text{ servings}} = \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{20 \text{ servings}}$

{tpc}[2][Finding the Cross Product]
  If $\frac{a}{b} = \frac{c}{d}$, then $ad = bc$
  {exp}/*Maybe a proof here or something idk */{\exp}
  The cross product essentially tells us we can multiply diagonally to get an equation with no fractions that we can {tag ..}solve{\tag}.

{tpc}[3][Solving Proportions]
  In order to solve a {tag ..}proportion{\tag}, we must first simplify the proportion in a way that we know how to solve by{tag ..}finding the cross product{\tag}. Remember, this will give us an equation.
  While doing this, remember to {tag ..}distribute{\tag} the products when needed
  {exp}{\exp}
  After finding the cross product, you will get a standard equation that can be solved. This can be {tag ..}linear{\tag}, or {tag ..}quadratic{\tag} in certain instances. Either way, solve as necessary for the variable
