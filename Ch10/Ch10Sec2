{2} Operations on Functions

Overview: use the sum, difference, product, quotient, and composition operations on functions.

Functions have five operations. Four of the operations are similar to their arithmetic equivalents: sum (addition), difference (subtraction), product (multiplication), and quotient (division). The fifth operation is composition. All of these operations follow the {tag} order of operations {\tag}.

As before, functions can be evaluated in two different ways. You may have to substitute the x, or input, with a specific number, or you may just have to simply combine the functions. The process for both is similar. 

For the basic operations, begin by evaluating each function separately. If it is a {tag} substitution {\tag} problem, then substitute, if not, then leave the function as is, and combine like terms using the appropriate operations: additition if the operation is addition, subtraction if the operation is subtraction, multiplication if the operation is multiplication, and division if the operation is division. 

Additon        (f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)
Subtraction    (f-g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)
Multiplication (f*g)(x) = f(x) * g(x)
Division       (f/g)(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}

Next, for the composition of two functions, we are evaluating the 'inner' function, then, using that as the input for the 'outer' function. This is given by (f o g)(x) = f(g(x)).

It is important to note that f(g(x)) is rarely the same as g(f(x)).
