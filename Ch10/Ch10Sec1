[Chapter 10] Functions
[Section 1] Function Notation

{tpc}[1][Function Notation]
  There are many different type of different equations we know how to work with in algebra, such as y=x^2-4x-8, (x-3)^2=y, and so on.
  Functional notation is necessary for more advanced algebra topics.


  There is also a special type of relation called a {tag ..}function {\tag}.

  Functions have at most one output for any input. Generally, x is the input variable and y is the output variable. Thus, for each x value there is at most one y value.

  We can test this using the {tag ..} vertical line test {\tag}. Take the x-values of a graph. If you construct a vertical line from the x-value and it touches more than one y-value, then the graph is not a function. If there is at most one y-value, then the graph is a function.

  {exp}
    /*Several different graphs*/
  {\exp}

  Using the vertical line test, check if the above graphs are functions.

  We can look at the above idea and use algebraic methods to test to see if the relationship is a function by solving for y. If we have only one solution, then it is a function.

  {exp}
    Is 3x^2-y=5 a function?		Solve the relation for y
    -3x^2    -3x^2
    /-1	/-1
    y=3x^2-5			Only one solution for y; thus, a function.
  {\exp}

  {exp}
    Is y^2-x=5 a function?		Solve the relation for y
    +x+x
    y^2=5+x		Square root of both sides
    $\sqrt{y^2}=+/-\sqrt{x+5}$	Simplify
    $y=+/- \sqrt{x+5}$		Two solutions for y(one +, one -)
    Not a function
  {\exp}

  For functional notation, we will use f(x) instead of y. Thus, f is the function with input variable x.

  The letters can be anything we want, usually f and x though. We could have g(x), h(y), and so on.

  We will also be interested in what inputs we can use for the function. These are called the domain.
{\tpc}
{def}[2][Domain]
  The Domain is the values that are put into an equation (generally the x values)

  {exp}
    Find the domain of f(x)= \frac{3x-1}{x^2+x-6}		Zero cannot be in the denominator of a fraction

    x^2+x-6		Solve by factoring
    (x+3)(x-2)	Set each factor not equal to zero
    x+3=/=0 and x-2 =/=0
    -3   -3	     +2   +2

    x=/=3   x =/=2		Our solution
  {\exp}
  Thus, x=-3 and x=2 is restricted from the domain.
  {exp}
    f(x) = 3x^2-x	There are no incorrect inputs
    Thus the domain of f(x) is R
  {\exp}

  When the domain of a function is R, that means that any number can be used for x.
  {exp}
    Find domain of $f(x)= \sqrt{2x-3}$	Square roots cannot be negative
    2x-3 >= 0
    +3   +3
    2x >= 3
    x >= \frac{3}{2}
    Thus the domain is restricted to $x \geq \frac{3}{2}$.
  {\exp}
  We can also see what the value of a function is at a specific x.

  We see this by substituting the x in the function with the specific input.
  {exp}

    f(x) = 3x^2-4x, find f(-2)	Substitute -2 for x
    f(-2) = 3(-2)^2-4(-2)		Evaluate
    f(-2) = 3(4)-4(-2)
    f(-2) = 12-4(-2)
    f(-2) = 12-(-8)
    f(-2) = 20			Our solution
  {\exp}
  {exp}

    h(x) = 3^{2x-6}; find h(4)	Substitue 4 for x
    h(4) = 3^{2*4-6}
    h(4) = 3^{8-6}
    h(4) = 3^{2}
    h(4) = 9			Our solution

  {\exp}

  {exp}

    k(a) = 2|a+4|; find k(-7)	Substitute -7 for a
    k(-7) = 2|-7+4|
    k(-7) = 2|-3|
    k(-7) = 2*3
    k(-7) = 6			Our solution

  {\exp}

  Once more, functions may take many forms but it does not change how we evaluate them by using substitution. We can also put more than just a single number as an input; we may put expressions as an input.

  {exp}

    g(x) = x^4+1; find g(3x)		Replace x with (3x)
    g(3x) = (3x)^4+1
    g(3x) = 81x^4+1				Our solution

  {\exp}
  {exp}

    p(t) = t^2-t; find p(t+1)		Replace t with (t+1)
    p(t+1) = (t+1)^2-(t+1)
    p(t+1) = t^2+2t+1-(t+1)
    p(t+1) = t^2+2t+1-t-1
    p(t+1) = t^2+t				Our solution

  {\exp}
