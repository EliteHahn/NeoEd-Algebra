{4} Point-Slope Form

The slope-intercept form is easier to remember, but you NEED to know the y-intercept to be  able to use it. What if you aren't given the y-intercept before hand?
That is when you use the Point-Slope Form!

{def}
{Point-Slope} An equation form of y-y1=m(x-x1), in which two points are known or can be found, with one being regarded as (x,y) and the other being (x1,y1). In this type of formula, one must know the location/coordinates of at least two points in the line and the slope, which can also be found from those two points!

{ex}
Lets say that we have a point (2,6) with the slope of 2/3. Write the equation using point-slope form!
Step 1: y-y1=m(x-x1)            (Rewrite the equation)
Step 2: y-6= (2/3)(x-2)         (Plug in the values)
Step 3: y-6= (2/3)x - (2/3)2    (Multiply the 2/3 slope to both part of what is found in the parenthesis)
Step 4: y= (2/3)x -(4/3) + 6    (Add the six to the opposite side and then combine the -4/3 with the +6)
Step 5: y= (2/3)x + 14/3        (You found the final equation!!!)

It is also possible to receive two coordinates and still find the final equation of the point slope form, as long as one uses the two points given to find the slope!

{ex} /* Use example 143 for this one*/

/*  2.4 Practice Page helpful, but really just choose six to eight problems from each section to show the variety of possible answers that one can receive! */
