{tpc}[1][Solving Absolute Value Inequalities]
  As you may recall, {tag ..} absolute value{\tag} is the distance from zero. When used in inequalities, things can get a bit complicated.
  In order to solve, we must remove the absolute value, and how we remove the absolute value depends on the {tag ..}inequality operator{\tag}
  Consider cases such as $\vert x \vert  < 2$, or when the absolute value is less than an expression. In this case, we use the special case of and equality, such that this becomes $-2 < x < 2$.
  /* Okay, so let's fix this section, cuz it sucks */
  {exp}{\exp}
  Since absolute value can be treated as distance, we can view this as the distance from x is less than 2
  Consider the case, $\vert x\vert > 2$, or the absolute value is greater than an expression.
  In this case, the equation is very similar to an OR expression, so this becomes $x > 2$ or $x < -2$
  Since absolute value is similar to distance, we can view this expression as, the distance from x is greater than 2.
  {exp}{\exp}
  Once we have written these as compound inequalities, all is left to do is {tag ..}solve them{\tag}, and {tag ..} graph them{\tag}
  Remember, when dealing with inequalities, to flip the sign when {tag ..}dividing and multiplying by negative numbers{\tag}. Also, if your {tag ..}absolute value is negative{\tag}, you have reached a contradiction, and there are no solutions
