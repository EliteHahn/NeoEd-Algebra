[Chapter 2] Slopes
[Section 3] Slope-Intercept Form
{def}[1][y-Intercept]
  The $y$-intercept is where a line crosses the $y$-axis, or to think of it mathematically, the point on the line where the $x$ value = 0. Because the $x$ value is zero, the point is written in the form $(0,b)$, where $b$ is the point on the $y$-axis where the line intersects it.
  You may wonder why such qualities as slope and $y$-intercept would be considered important. Well, they can actually be used find a equation of a graph much quicker and easier if we also have the {tag ..}slope{\tag}. See the next section about {tag ..}slope intercept form{\tag}.

{tpc}[2][Slope Intercept Form]
  The {tag ..}$y$-intercept{\tag} is a very powerful piece of information to help finding the equation of a line. Let's suppose that we have the {tag ..}slope{\tag} of a line, as well as the $y$-intercept, that is, where the line crosses the $y$-axis. Remember that an {tag ..}equation{\tag} shows the relationship between {tag ..}variables{\tag}, and the primary purpose of a {tag ..}graph{\tag} is to show this relationship. So {tag ..}let's say{\tag} we have a point on this line, $(x,y)$. Using the {topic ..}formula for slope{\tag}, let's see if we can get an equation:

  /*Throw in the manipulation of slope formula to get slope intercept form*/
  $y = mx + b$ is a formula that will be immensely helpful for algebra. This formula means, that if you have a slope and an intercept of a line, you can get the equation of that line using this form! So if you have these two things, or you can get these two things by looking at a graph, you now have a formula that describes this line for all values of $x$ and $y$.
  We have seen this slope-intercept form and its use, but it isn't the only form through which we can make equations out of lines and graphs, which we will discuss in future sections.
