[Chapter 2] Slopes
[Section 3] Slope-Intercept Form
{def}[1][y-Intercept]
  The $y$-intercept is where a line crosses the $y$-axis, or to think of it mathematically, where the $x$ value = 0. Due to the $x$ being equal to zero for the y-intercept, it is also often written as a coordinate point known as (0, $b$) with $b$ being the value found when the line crosses the vertical axis!
  You may wonder why such qualities as slope and $y$-intercept would be considered important. Well, they can actually be used to make a graph much quicker and easier.

  Let's see what happens when we put the $(0,b)$ coordinates for the y-intercept into the slope equation of $m=\frac{y2-y1}{x2-x1}$, with the knowledge that any other point on the line would just follow the normal $(x,y)$ formula:
  $m=(y-b)/(x-0)$
  $We can simplify this to $m=(y-b)/x$, and further simplified through multiplication to make $mx=y-b$.
  Finally, we can add $b$ to make a final SLOPE-INTERCEPT equation with the form $y=mx+b$
  {exp} ex133 and ex 134{\exp}
  You can use this to draw a point from the y-intercept and then use a slope to find the next points of the line.

  We have seen this slope-intercept form and its use, but it isn't the only form through which we can make equations out of lines and graphs.
