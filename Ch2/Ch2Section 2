{2} Slope

- As we saw from the last section, graphs can be used to draw individual points or even a set of points in a line! But we can also gather information about QUALITIES of these lines we create when we connect these dots. One such quality is...

{def}{1}
{Slope} A measure of the "steepness" of a line or structure, along with describing the direction of the line; the change in height over a given distance (often represented by m)
    When the slope is large, it is steep. When the slope is small, it is relatively flat.
    When the line goes up from the left to the right, it will have a positive slope. When it goes down from left to right, the slope will be negative.

  The slope is often described as how far the line runs horizontally over how far the rises vertically. So, to find slope, we use the fraction rise/run, or change in y values/change in x values.
  Choose two points on a line and measure the difference in "rise" over "run."

  {ex} Lets think of Jamie's house again!
  Remember how Jamie's house was 2 units north of you, and 1 unit to the east? Lets think about the slope in THIS equation!

  /* Example 124 */

  How is one to find the slope between two points?
    Using two points with their own individual y and x values, use this equation for slope:
    (y2-y1)/(x2-x1) or better understood as (the 2nd y value - the 1st y value)/ (the 2nd x value- the 1st x value)


  How about the slope of a horizontal line or a vertical line?
  Horizontal will result in a slope of zero. Vertical will result in a slope that is undefined. I recommend looking at example 125 for an explanation of why this is the case!

  /* Example 130-131 are actually very good images and examples to use*?

  /* Practice Page 100-101 are rather helpful*/
