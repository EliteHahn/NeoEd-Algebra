[Chapter 2]Graphing
[Section 5] Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

{def}[1][Parallel Lines]
  If two lines are parallel, the lines do not, nor will they ever, intersect! And to look at it mathematically, these lines will have the SAME slope, but different y-intercepts.
{\def}
{def}[2][Perpendicular Lines]
  If two lines are perpendicular, these lines intersect to make right angles (90 degrees). Looking at it mathematically, these lines have slopes that are "NEGATIVE {tag ..}Reciprocals{\tag}" of each other!
{\def}
{def}[3][Reciprocal]
 The reciprocal of a number can be found by inverting the numerator and denominator of a number to make another number. In Perpendicular Lines, the slopes must be reciprocals, but one must be positive and the other be negative.

 {exp}1/5 and 5/1 are reciprocals.{\exp}

    Find the slope of a line PARALLEL to 5y-2x=7.
    - This means that the slopes will be the SAME, so you just need to find the slope of this equation and that will be answer.
    Step 1: 5y-2x=7
    Step 2: 5y=2x+7
    Step 3: y= (2/5)x + 7/5
    And now we know that the slope of a line PARALLEL to it would be the same!!!

  {exp}
    What is the slope of a line perpendicular to the above line?
    - It is the negative reciprocal, so the slope of a perpendicular line is (-5/2).
