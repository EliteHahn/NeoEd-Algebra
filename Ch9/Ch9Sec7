{9} Quadratics

Section
{7} Rectangles

An application of solving quadratic equations comes from the formula for the area of a rectangle.
Area of a rectangle is width x length. To solve problems with rectangles, draw a picture to help you represent the problem and use the picture to set up our equation.
Here is an example:
{ex1} The length of a rectangle is 3 MORE than the width. If the area is 40 square inches, what are the dimensions?
/* Show image that is seen in example 484 on page 357*/

{ex2} /* Example 485 or 486 is good for how to compare two different rectangles.*/
{ex3} The area is 168 square cm. The perimeter is 52cm. What are the dimensions of the rectangle? /* Input the image from example 487*/
  xy=168
  2x+2y=52
  -2x   -2x
  2y= -2x+52 (Now divide the entire equation by 2)
  y= -x + 26
  If we know that xy=168, then substitute in the y, so that it is x(-x+26)=168. If we distribute, -x^2 + 26x= 168. To make it easier, divide everything by the -1 in front of the x^2 -26x=-168. We now must solve the remainder of this by Completing the Square.
  (26/2)^2=169. Equation is now x^2-26x+169=-168+169 (add 169 from completing the square to both sides).
  x^2-26x+169=1 is our new equation, and we can factor this further to be (x-13)^2=1. So, after we square root both sides, x-13=+-1, and x could equal 14 or 12! Plug this back into the y=-x +26, making it either y=12 or y=14.
  Since it is a RECTANGLE, the sides cant be the same, so the dimension is 12cm by 14cm!
