Section
{6} Quadratic in Form

So far, our methods for solving quadratics have been factoring, completing the square, and the quadratic formula.
Although the normal equation for a quadratic is 0= ax^2 + bx + c, there are ways to solve problems with higher or lower powers than a power of 2.This can be done if the equation is in the Quadratic Form!

{def1}
  {Quadratic Formula} 0=ax^m + bx^n + c where m=2n. An equation is in this form when one of the exponents on a variable is double the exponent on the same variable somewhere else in the equation. For instance:

{ex1} x^4 - 13x^2 + 36= 0.
y=x^2             (set new variable equal to the variable present with the SMALLER exponent)
y^2=x^4           (square both sides)
y^2 - 13y + 36= 0 (substitute y for x^2 and y^2 for x^4)
(y-9)(y-4)=0      (Solve. We can solve this from here on)
y=9 and y=4
Since y=x^2, then 9=x^2 and 4=x^2.
The x=+3,-3,+2,-2.

The solutions to the above were rational. However, we can also have irrational or complex solutions to our equations.
/* Example 480 and Example 483 is good way to show how complex solutions*/
/* 9.6 Practice on Page 356, but look through them to find which ones will feature complex and rational solutions.
