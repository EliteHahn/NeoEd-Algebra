Section
{3} Complete the Square

When solving quadratic equations, we have used factoring to solve for our variable.
However, the problem with factoring is NOT ALL equations cannot be factored. Consider the following equations:
x^2-2x-7=0. This cannot be factored, but there are two solutions to this equation: 1+(2 times radical 2) and 1-(2 times radical 2). If this solution was found without the use of factoring, then HOW did we solve this equation?
The process used was "Completing The Square"

{def1}
  {Completing The Square} Process in which the quadratic equation is changed into a perfect square which can easily be solved with the square root property. If a quadratic is of the form x^2+bx+c, and a PERFECT SQUARE, the third term C can be found by the formula (b/2)^2. It consists of 5 steps:
  1.Separate constant term from variables
  2.Divide each term by a
  3.Find value to complete the square: (b/2)^2
  4.Add c value to both sides of the equation.
  5.Factor it, and solve by even root property
