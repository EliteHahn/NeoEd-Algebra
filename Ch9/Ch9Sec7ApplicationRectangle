{tpc}[1][Finding the Area of a Rectangle with Variable Lengths]
  An application of solving quadratic equations comes from the formula for the area of a rectangle.
  Area of a rectangle is width x length. To solve problems with rectangles, draw a picture to help you represent the problem and use the picture to set up our equation.
  Here is an example:
  {exp}
    The length of a rectangle is 3 MORE than the width. If the area is 40 square inches, what are the dimensions?
    /* Show image that is seen in example 484 on page 357*/
    /* Example 485 or 486 is good for how to compare two different rectangles.*/
    The area is 168 square cm. The perimeter is 52cm. What are the dimensions of the rectangle? /* Input the image from example 487*/
    $xy=168$
    $2x+2y=52$
    $-2x   -2x$
    $2y= -2x+52$ (Now divide the entire equation by 2)
    $y= -x + 26$
    If we know that $xy=168$, then substitute in the y, so that it is $x(-x+26)=168$. If we distribute, $-x^2 + 26x= 168$. To make it easier, divide everything by the $-1$ in front of the $x^2 -26x=-168$. We now must solve the remainder of this by {tag ..}Completing the Square{\tag}.
    $(26/2)^2=169$. Equation is now $x^2-26x+169=-168+169$ (add 169 from completing the square to both sides).
    $x^2-26x+169=1$ is our new equation, and we can factor this further to be $(x-13)^2=1$. So, after we square root both sides, $x-13=+-1$, and $x$ could equal $14$ or $12$! Plug this back into the $y=-x +26$, making it either $y=12$ or $y=14$.
    Since it is a RECTANGLE, the sides cant be the same, so the dimension is 12cm by 14cm!
