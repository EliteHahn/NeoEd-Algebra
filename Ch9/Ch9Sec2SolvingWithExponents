[Chapter 9] Quadratics
[Section 2] Solving with Exponents

{tpc}[1][Solving Equations with Exponents]
  Exponents can also be solved for in equations, but in this case, it is important to know two properties in order to solve:
  1. {tag ..}Odd Root Property{\tag}
  2. {tag ..}Even Root Property{\tag}
  Good Rules to know:
  - When solving with exponents, ALWAYS isolate the part with exponents before taking roots.
  - When the exponents are fractions, convert the fractional exponent into a RADICAL EXPRESSION in order to solve. This is based off of the rule "a to the power of a fraction m/n= (a to the nth root) to the power of m"
    {ex2} (4x+1)^(2/5)=9
    ( (4x+1)to the 5th root) to the power of 2= 9. Proceed after that

  /* 9.2 Practice- Solving with Exponents page 336 is pretty cool */

{def}[2][Odd Root Property]
  Odd Root Property states if $a^n=b$, then $a=b$ to the nth root whenever the n is ODD", or better shown by example, if 2 (a) to the 3rd (n) power = 8 (b), then $2= 8$ to the 3rd root.
  To make this easier to visualize, all that you must do is move the number you use as an exponent on one side over as the root on the other!
  /* Draw nice image, David, to show this in a more easily explained manner*/

{def}[3][Even Root Property]
  The Even Root Property states "if a^n = b, then a= + or - b to the nth root whenever n is EVEN," which I believe this example can show in a better way!
  {exp} $x^4=16$
    There are actually TWO numbers that can work in this scenario when we take the 4th root of both sides! You may think "But only 2 can work in this case." However, remember that the property claims the solution to be the + and - version of that number. So the two solutions are actually + and - 2!
    Multiply the negatives out if it helps. (-2x-2x-2x-2)= 16, which is our answer. It ends up being +16 because an even amount of negative numbers multiplied together will create a positive number, and that goes for roots and exponents, too!

    /* Show example 451 and 452 because it helps in understanding how to go about solving more complex forms of previously explained material with this knowledge. */
