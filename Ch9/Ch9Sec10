Chapter
{9} Quadratics

Section
{10} Revenue and Distance

While this seems like an odd combination, it is important to know that, with quadratics, revenue and distance problems are set up almost identically to each other, followed by solving as we did with "Simultaneous Product Equations."

/* Insert the very helpful Template Table from page 373.
/* This entire section is actually very heavily based on the inclusion of the table with each step, so until I learn how to input these images into this atom system, I recommend that we all more closely look at Example 497 for Revenue and Example 499 and ITS associated template table for Distance. */
/* 9.10 Practice section has 22 problems, which is way too many. I believe 5 types of revenue and 5 types of distance would suffice */
