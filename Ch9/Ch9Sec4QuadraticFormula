{def1}
  {quadratic formula} General formula of a quadratic is ax^2 + bx + c = 0. When this formula is "solved" through completing the square x=(-b +or- radical [b^2 -4ac])/2a.

/* Example 467 and then 468 or 470 for solutions with impossible numbers */

Here is a suggested process to decide which method would be best to use for solving a problem
1. If it can easily factor, solve by factoring.
2. If a=1 and b is even, complete the square.
3. Otherwise, solve by the quadratic formula.

/* 9.4 Practice Page 347 is pretty good, but try to choose just maybe 8-10 problems that kids should really try to do, and write off the rest as extras. of the 8-10, make the ones you choose varied in in the type of answer received or the type of process by which the solution was found. */
