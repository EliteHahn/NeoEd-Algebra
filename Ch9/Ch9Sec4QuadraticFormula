[Section 4] Quadratic Formula

{def}[1][Quadratic Formula]
  A General formula of a quadratic is $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$. When this formula is "solved" through completing the square x=(-b +or- radical [b^2 -4ac])/2a.

  /* Example 467 and then 468 or 470 for solutions with impossible numbers */

  Here is a suggested process to decide which method would be best to use for solving a problem
  1. If it can easily factor, solve by factoring.
  2. If a=1 and b is even, complete the square.
  3. Otherwise, solve by the quadratic formula.

  /* 9.4 Practice Page 347 is pretty good, but try to choose just maybe 8-10 problems that kids should really try to do, and write off the rest as extras. of the 8-10, make the ones you choose varied in in the type of answer received or the type of process by which the solution was found. */
