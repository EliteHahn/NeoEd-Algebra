Section
{11} Graphs of Quadratics

Just as we had been able to draw pictures for the solutions to linear equations a few sections ago, it is also possible to use a table to organize our information and make a graph for our quadratic equations!
When we have an x^2 as the biggest exponent in an equation, our graph will no longer look like a straight line, but rather, it will look like a U-shape.

{def1}
  {Parabola} A U-shape found in the graphs of Quadratics

Here are the Points to search for graphing while making your table for a y=ax^2+bx+c equation, and a method written for how to find each one:
1. "Point A": The y-intercept, where the graph crosses the vertical y-axis.
Method of Point A: Found by making x=0, to simply down to y=c.
2. "Points B and C": The x-intercepts, where the graph crosses the horizontal x-axis.
 Found by making y=0, or solving 0=ax^2+bx+c
3. "Point D": This is the Vertex.
 Let x=(-b/2a) to find x. Then plug this value into the equation to find y.

{def2}
  {Vertex} The point where the graph curves and changes directions.

/* Example 503 is good.*/

/*All of those types of graphs and their associated equations on page 383 are incredible please put them in.*/

/* 9.11 Practice is 20 problems, but shortening it down to maybe problems like 3, 8, 12, 15, and 19 */
