[Chapter 9] Quadratics
[Section 11] Graphs of Quadratics

{tpc}[1][Graphing Quadratics]
  Just as we had been able to draw pictures for the solutions to linear equations a few sections ago, it is also possible to use a table to organize our information and make a graph for our quadratic equations!
  When we have an $x^2$ as the biggest exponent in an equation, our graph will no longer look like a straight line, but rather, it will look like a U-shape.
  Here are the Points to search for graphing while making your table for a y=ax^2+bx+c equation, and a method written for how to find each one:
  1. "Point A": The y-intercept, where the graph crosses the vertical y-axis.
  Method of Point A: Found by making x=0, to simply down to y=c.
  2. "Points B and C": The x-intercepts, where the graph crosses the horizontal x-axis.
   Found by making y=0, or solving 0=ax^2+bx+c
  3. "Point D": This is the Vertex.
   Let x=(-b/2a) to find x. Then plug this value into the equation to find y.
   /* Example 503 is good.*/

   /*All of those types of graphs and their associated equations on page 383 are incredible please put them in.*/

   /* 9.11 Practice is 20 problems, but shortening it down to maybe problems like 3, 8, 12, 15, and 19 */
