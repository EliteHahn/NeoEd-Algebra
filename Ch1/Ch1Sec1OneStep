{def}{1}
  {Linear Equation} An equation with variables with the properties:
    The variables are multiplied only to {tag mod}constants{\tag}.
    {ex}
      /*examples for each plz*/
    {\ex}
    Each term must only have at most one variable.
    {ex}
    {\ex}
    Variables are only used

{topic}{2} SOLVING ONE-STEP LINEAR EQUATIONS
  If there is a portion of the problem is "missing" (in other words, replaced by a variable), we may want to find the missing value.
  {ex}
    /*Put in examples of equations that need to be solved*/
    4x + 16 = -4
  {\ex}
  In this example, {tag 0.4.1}plugging in the number{\tag} -5 as x allows us to evaluate the equation and solve, and as we clearly see that since both sides of the equation are the same, -4 = -4, x = -5. However, if we were to plug in any other value, such as 3, we would get the false statement of 28 = -4. Because of this, we know that x is not 3, and that x is -5.
  "Guess and check" is not a very good way to find the value of x, because these equations can be very complicated. Instead, we should find a way to solve equations that work for all equations.
  To solve equations, the general rule is to do the opposite operation on both sides of the equation.
  {ex}
    /* examples of 1 step equations being solved by doing the reverse operation */
    /* Make sure that each does all operations, add, subtract, multiplication and division*/
