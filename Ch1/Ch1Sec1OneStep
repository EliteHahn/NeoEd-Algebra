[Section 1] One-Step Equations

{def}[1][Linear Equation]
    In algebra, a linear equation is an equation with variables with these properties:
    The variables are multiplied only to {tag ..}constants{\tag}.
    {exp}
      /*examples for each plz*/
    {\exp}
    Each term must only have at most one variable.
    {exp}
    {\exp}

{tpc}[2][Solving One-Step Linear Equations]
  If there is a portion of the problem is "missing" (in other words, replaced by a variable), we may want to find the missing value.
  {exp}
    /*Put in examples of equations that need to be solved*/
    4x + 16 = -4
  {\exp}
  In this example, {tag ..}plugging in the number{\tag} -5 as $x$ allows us to evaluate the equation and solve, and as we clearly see that since both sides of the equation are the same, $-4 = -4$, $x = -5$. However, if we were to plug in any other value, such as 3, we would get the false statement of 28 = -4. Because of this, we know that $x$ is not 3, and that $x$ is -5.
  "Guess and check" is not a very good way to find the value of $x$, because these equations can be very complicated. Instead, we should find a way to solve equations that work for all equations.
  To solve equations, the general rule is to do the opposite operation on both sides of the equation.
