[Section 2] Two-Step Equations

{tpc}[1][Solving Two-Step Equations]
  Just as with {tag ..}solving one-step equations{\tag}, the important thing to remember is to do the {tag ..}opposite operation{\tag}.
  If there are multiple steps that need to be solved, we must also use {tag ..}order of operations{\tag} backwards as well.

  If a number subtracts completely, for example, if all terms from a side of the equation is removed, it's important to remember that there's still a number there: 0!

  Solving two step or multistep equations is very important, because in future problems, there will be many steps that need to be taken to solve for a variable. Although these equations are complicated, the last two steps are a two-step equation like we are solving here. This is why it is very important to master two-step equations now!
