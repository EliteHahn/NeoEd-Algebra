Section
{5} Parallel and Perpendicular Lines

{def1}
{Parallel Lines} These lines do not, nor will they ever, intersect! And to look at it mathematically, these lines will have the SAME slope, but different y-intercepts.

{def2}
{Perpendicular Lines} These lines intersect to make right angles (90 degrees). Looking at it mathematically, these lines have slopes that are "NEGATIVE Reciprocals" of each other!

{def3}
{Reciprocal} These are created by inverting the numerator and denominator of a number to make another number.In Perpendicular Lines, the slopes must be reciprocals, but one must be positive and the other be negative.

{Reciprocal ex}
1/5 and 5/1 are reciprocals.

{ex1}
Find the slope of a line PARALLEL to 5y-2x=7.
- This means that the slopes will be the SAME, so you just need to find the slope of this equation and that will be answer.
Step 1: 5y-2x=7
Step 2: 5y=2x+7
Step 3: y= (2/5)x + 7/5
And now we know that the slope of a line PARALLEL to it would be the same!!!
{ex2}
What is the slope of a line perpendicular to the above line?
- It is the negative reciprocal, so the slope of a perpendicular line is (-5/2).
