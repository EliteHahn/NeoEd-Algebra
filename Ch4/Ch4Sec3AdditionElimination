[Chapter 4] System of Equations
[Section 3] Addition/Elimination

{def}[1][Addition/Elimination]
  An algebraic approach where one adds or subtracts the given equations to eliminate one of the variables.

{tpc}[2][SHORTCOMINGS OF SUBSTITUTION]
  While Substitution will generally be the most common method in solving systems of equations, there are cases where it is not effect;
  specifically, if it is not possible to isolate a lone variable/would result in difficult coefficients.

{tpc}[3][HOW TO USE ADDITION/ELIMINATION METHODS]
  The Addition/Elimination method can be performed in a 5-step process;
  Given a System:
  1. Line up variables and constants
  2. Multiply to get opposite (use LCD)
  3. Add
  4. Solve
  5. Plug into either original equation and solve

  {exp}
    Given the equations: 2x-5y=-13 and -3y+4=-5x; notice that attempting to isolate either variable in both equations would result in fractions in the co
    Line up the variables and constants in the equations: ax+by=c --> 2x-5y=-13 and 5x-3y=-4;
    Multiply to get opposites (use LCD): in this case, we can try to eliminate the x variable by first finding the LCD of 2 and 5. That value is 10.
    We result with the equations -5(2x-5y)=(-13)(-5) --> -10x+25y=65 and 2(5x-3y)=(-4)2 --> 10x-6y=-8
    Add the two equations, which would eliminate the x variable and result in --> 19y=57
    Solve for y: 19y/19=57/19 --> y=3
    Plug y=3 into either original equation: 2x-5(3)=-13 --> 2x=2 --> x=1
    Solution: (1,3)
