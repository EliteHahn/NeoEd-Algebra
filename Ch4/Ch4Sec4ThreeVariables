{tpc}[1][SOLVING A SYSTEM OF THREE EQUATIONS]
  The key in solving a system of three equations is keeping your work and your equations organized.
  The process of solving the system is in the following steps:
  1. Reduce three variables down to two. This is done by using the Addition/Elimination method on two of the equations. The new equation formed will be labeled as equation A.
  2. Using a different combination of the original equations, eliminate the same variable selected in step 1, this new equation will be labeled as equation B:
    (ex. In a system with variables $X,Y,Z$; if equation A eliminated Z and was left with $aX+bY=c$, then equation $B$ should also eliminate $Z$)
  3. Now, with equations A and B, we will use the Addition/Elimination method to reduce the two variables down to just one.
  4. Solve for the remaining variable and obtain a numerical value.
  5. Plug this value into either equation A or B, to obtain a numerical value for the second variable.
  6. Plug both these values into one of the original equations, to obtain a value for the third variable; the system is solved.

  Solving a system of more than two equations is not more difficult, it is just more imperative to remain organized.
