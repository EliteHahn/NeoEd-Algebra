{def}[1][System of Equations]
  A system of equations is two or more equations used to solve for variables;
  One must have at least one equation for each variable needed to be solved.
  {exp}
    If a question wants to determine the values of X and Y, there must be at least two equations; for variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, three equations are needed

      /*insert Example 165*/ For a system of two equations, graphs on the coordinate plane are a very useful tool.

{tpc}[2][USING GRAPHS FOR SYSTEMS OF TWO EQUATIONS]
  The key point (no pun intended) to remember is that the intercept of the two lines is the solution to the system of equations.
  {exp}
    Imagine we are given an equation with two variables: $3x+y=10$. We can procede to graph this equation onto a coordinate plane;
    First we can reorganize the equation into the familiar form: $y=mx+b$ --> $y=-3x+10$, and plot these points onto our graph;
    Then, we can connect these points and form the line that represents the equation: every single point on the line is an answer to this equation.
    Now, let us add in a second line: x-y=5. We can graph y=x-5 onto the plane. Every point on this new line is a solution to the equation.
    However, the only point that is a solution to BOTH equations is the point where their two lines intersect. At that point, the $X$ and $Y$ value can satisfy both equations.

    Special Cases: When the lines of the two equations have the same slope;
    if the lines are different (parallel), there is no solution;
    if the lines are the in fact the same, there are infinite solutions.
