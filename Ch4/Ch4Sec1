{def}{1}
  {System of Equations} A term defining two or more equations used to solve for variables;
    One must have at least one equation for each variable needed to be solved.
    {ex}
      If a question wants to determine the values of X and Y, there must be at least two equations; for variables X, Y, and Z, three equations are needed

      /*insert Example 165*/ For a system of two equations, graphs on the coordinate plane are a very useful tool.

{topic}{2} USING GRAPHS FOR SYSTEMS OF TWO EQUATIONS
  The key point (no pun intended) to remember is that the intercept of the two lines is the solution to the system of equations.
  {ex}
    Imagine we are given an equation with two variables: 3x+y=10. We can procede to graph this equation onto a coordinate plane;
    First we can reorganize the equation into the familar form: y=mx+b --> y=-3x+10, and plot these points onto our graph;
    Then, we can connect these points and form the line that represents the equation: every single point on the line is an answer to this equation.
    Now, let us add in a second line: x-y=5. We can graph y=x-5 onto the plane. Every point on this new line is a solution to the equation.
    However, the only point that is a solution to BOTH equations is the point where their two lines intersect. At that point, the X and Y value can satisfy both equations.

    Special Cases: When the lines of the two equations have the same slope; 
    if the lines are different (parallel), there is no solution;
    if the lines are the in fact the same, there are infinite solutions.
