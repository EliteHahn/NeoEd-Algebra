[Chapter 4] System of Equations
[Section 5] Application: Value Problems

{def}[1][Value Problems]
  Value problems are a common application for systems of equations. For these types of problems, every variable has a known value attached to it;
  For example, if our variables are different types of coins, then we know that pennies are worth 1 cent, nickels 5 cents, dimes 10 cents, etc.

{tpc}[2][The Table]
  Tables are very useful in understanding and solving value problems. The basic structure of the table for a two variable value problem is as follows;
  Rows: There will be 3 rows, for variable 1, variable 2, and the total
  Columns: There will be 3 columns, one for quantity(Q) of each variable, one for the value(V) of each variable, and one for the total value, which is (QxV)

  Most value problems will center around this table. Problems will often leave sections of the table blank;
  The goal of these problems is to fill in the table using the given data and information.
