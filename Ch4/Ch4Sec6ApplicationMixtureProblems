[Chapter 4] System of Equations
[Section 6] Application: Mixture Problems

{def}[1][Mixture Problems]
  Mixture problems are another application for system of equations. They are problems were two different solutions (liquid mixtures) are mixed together to create a new solution;
  These questions are common in fields such as chemistry, where the mixing of different concentrations is an integral part of experiments.

{tpc}[2][Solving Mixture Problems]
  Mixture problems use a similar table to the ones in Value problems. However, the labels are sightly altered;
  Rows: There are three rows in a standard two solution mixture problem, Item 1, Item 2, and Final
  Column: There are three columns, labeled as Amount, Part, and Total

  The Amount column is the volume of the solution, and the Part column is the concentration percentage within the solution.
  The Total column is the result of multiplying the Amount with the Part (expressed in a percentage or decimal)

  Mixture problems are often expressed in these tables, or can be constructed into these tables. Usually, some of the cells are blank;
  It is the objective of these problems to fill in the missing values.
