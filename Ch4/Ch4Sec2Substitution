[Chapter 4] System of Equations
[Section 2] Substitution

{def}[1][Substitution]
  Substitution is an algebraic approach to solving Systems of Equations that involves using one equation to substitute an entire variable in the other equation.

{tpc}[2][SHORTCOMINGS OF GRAPHING]
  While graphing is an excellent visual aid that helps explain how Systems of Equations work, and why answers derived algebraically make sense, they are inefficient;
  They are difficult to use with large numbers;
  They are challenging when numbers are not easily graphed: decimals, irrational numbers, etc.;
  They are more time consuming and generally use more space than algebraic methods.

{tpc}[3][HOW TO USE SUBSTITUTION (For System of Two Equations)]
  Substitution can be performed in a 5-step algebraic process;
    Given a System:
    1. Find the lone variable
    2. Solve for the lone variable
    3. Substitute into the untouched equation
    4. Solve
    5. Plug into lone variable equationi and evaluate

    As we have seen in graphing, it is possible for a System of Equations to have zero or inffinite solutions.
