[Chapter 6] Factoring
[Section 1] Greatest Common Factor

{def}[1][Factor]
	If we have an expression $e$, all expressions that evenly divide $e$ are called Factors of $e$. The expression $e$ can be anything, a number, a polynomial, a term. Similarly, the Factors of $e$ can also be any of those things as well.

{def}[2][Greatest Common Denominator]
	The Greatest Common Denominator of a group of terms is the largest value that can evenly divide each term in the group.
	{exp}{\exp}
	Why is this important? Because when we find the greatest common denominator of a group of terms, we are able to do a technique called {tag ..}factoring{\tag}, where you simplify an expression by taking out the greatest common denominator from all the terms.

{tpc}[3][Using the Greatest Common Denominator to Factor]

	A factored polynomial makes it easier to {tag ..}solve equations{\tag}, learn behaviors of :tag ..}graphs{\tag}, and work with fractions, and more.
	Previously, we multiplied monomials by polynomials by {tag ..}distributing {\tag}, solving problems such as $4x^2(2x^2-3x+8) = 8x^4-12x^3+32x$. In this section we will work the same problems backwards, starting with 8x^2-12x^3+32x and work backwards to 4x^2(2x^2-3x+8).

	This is done by identifying the Greatest Common Factor, GCF, of a polynomial. This is similar to the GCF of numbers. The following example illustrates:

	{exp}
	{\exp}
	For polynomials a similar concept applies. We find the GCF of the same variables, using the lowest exponent, as shown below:
	{exp}
	{\exp}

	To factor out the GCF of a polynomial we need to identify the GCF of all of the terms, then divide each term by the GCF.

	An example below illustrates:

	{exp}
		$4x^2-20x+16$	GCF is 4. 	Divide each term by 4.
		$\frac{4x^2}{4}=x^2, \frac{-20x}{4}=-5x, \frac{16}{4}=4$	This is what is left inside of the parenthesis.
		$4(x^2-5x+4)$			The solution.
	{\exp}

	When factoring, we can check our solutoins by {tag ..}multiplying{\tag} (in this case, {tag ..}distributing) {\tag} . The solution should be the original equation.
	{exp}
		$25x^4-15x^3+20x^2$		GCF is $5x^2$. Divide each term by this.
		$\frac{25x^4}{5x^2}=5x^2, \frac{-15x^3}5x^2=-3x, \frac{20x^2}{5x^2}=4$ This is what is left inside of the parenthesis.
		$5x^2(5x^2-3x+4)$ The solution.
	{\exp}
	{exp}
		$3x^3y^2z+5x^4y^3z^5-4xy^4$ GCF is xy^2, divide each term by this.
		$\frac{3x^3y^2z}{xy^2}=3x^2, \frac{5x^4y^3z^5}{xy^2}, \frac{-4xy^4}{xy^2}=-4y2$	This is what is left inside of the parenthesis.
		$xy^2(3x^2z+5x^3yz^5-4y^2)$	Our solution.
	{\exp}

	{exp}
		$21x^3+14x^2+7x$ GCF is 7x. Divide each term by this.
    $\frac{21x^3}{7x} = 3x^2, \frac{14x^2}{7x} = 2x, \frac{7x} = 1$		This is what is left inside of the parenthesis.
		$x(3x^2+2x+1)$		Our solution.
	{\exp}
	Note that the GCF was 7x and 7x was also one of the terms. When factoring out the 7x, the division gives us 1, and not zero. Students will often make the mistake of factoring out and getting zero, which is incorrect because factoring will never make terms dissapear. Anything divided by itself is 1.

	We can simply identify the GCF and put it in front of the parenthesis as shown in the two following examples:

	{exp}

		12x^5y^2-6x^4y^4+8x^3y^5	GCF is 2x^3y^2. Put this in front of the parenthesis and divide.
		2x^3y^2(6x^2-3xy^2+4y^3)	Our solution.
	{\exp}

	{exp}

		$18a^4b^3-27a^3b^3+9a^2b^3$	GCF is 9a^2b^3. Divide each term by this.
		$9a^2b^3(2a^2-3a+1)$		Our solution.
