[Chapter 6] Factoring
[Section 4] Trinomials of the Form $ax^2 + bx + c$

{tpc}[1][Factoring Trinomials where Coefficient of $x^2$ is Not 1]
	When {tag ..}factoring trinomials{\tag}, we reversed the process of {tag ..}distribution{\tag} to show why we could use the shortcut where $x^2 + bx + c$ could be simplified to the form {tag ..}$(x-m)(x-n)$.
	However, we noted that this process only works when the {tag ..}coefficient{\tag} of the first term, $x^2$, is 1, meaning the first term is just $x^2$.
	{exp}{\exp}
	{nex}{\nex}
	However, what if the coefficeint is not 1? What if we have a question such as $5x^2 + 16x + 12$? We can't just use the {tag ..}previous method{\tag} to try and factor this because it doesn't consider the 5 in front of the $x^2$.
	The fact that we have $5x^2$ essentially means that when we factor our equation, it's going to look something like $(px+m)(qx+n)$, where $p,q,m$ and $n$ are usually numbers. Let's {tag ..}expand this{\tag}, to get us $pqx^2 + mqx + nqx + nm$, using whatever method you like ({tag ..}FOILing{\tag} or {tag ..}distributing{\tag}). Notice how this isn't too different from our examples when {tag ..}$a$ equaled 1{\tag}. But instead of having $x^2 + mx + nx + nm$, we have a few more letters in our terms.
	So to factor an expression of the form $ax^2 + bx + c$, we can follow these steps:
	1. Multiply $a$ and $c$ together.
	2. Find two numbers that multiply to $ac$ that add to $b$. This is very similar to the process of {tag ..}factoring $x^2+bx+c$, except instead of us trying to split $c$, we are splitting $a \times c$.
	3. Once you find two numbers that fit these conditions, let's call them $p$ and $q$, split up the middle term, $bx$ to $px + qx$. Remember, this is possible because we know that $p$ and $q$ add up to the middle coefficient, $b$. Combining like terms in $px + qx$ gives us $(p+q)x$ and as we just stated, $p+q = b$, so this is the same as $bx$
	4. Now you have a question of the form $ax^2 + px + qx + c$. If the expression was factorable, you will be able to factor by grouping! Once you do this, you will get your answer.


	We can also apply this process to polynomials of two variables. The process is exactly the same, except you will need to keep track of two variables.

	We should always see if we can factor out a GCF from all of theterms of the polynomial. It will make factoring the rest of the polynomial easier.

	Similar to how some trinomials when $a=1$, not all trinomials can be factored. If there is no combination that multiply and add correctly then the polynomial is prime and cannot be factored.

	{exp}
		3x^2+2x-7		Multiply to a*c=(3)(-7)=-21, add to 2
	  -3(7) and -7(3)		Only two ways to factor -21; no combination adds to 2
		Prime; cannot be factored		Our solution
