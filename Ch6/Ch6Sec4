{4} TRINOMIALS WHERE A =/= 1

Overview: factor trinomials using the ac method when the coefficient of x^2 is not one.

When factoring trinomials {\tag trinomial} we used the ac method {\tag ac method} and factoring by grouping {\tag grouping}. The ac method to split the middle term gets it name from the equation ax^2+bx+c, where a is the coefficient of x^2, b is the coefficient of x, and c is the constant. 

We call it the ac method because we multiply the coefficient a by the coefficient c to find what we want to multiply to. We then find the factors of a*c and pick the pair which adds to the middle term. An example below illustrates for instances where a =/= 1.

{ex}

	3x^2+11x+6		Multiply to a*c=(3)(6)=18, add to 11
      3x^2+9x+2x+6		The numbers are 9 and 2, split the middle term
    3x(x+3)+2(x+3)		Factor by grouping
       (3x+2)(x+3)		Our solution

When a=1, we were able to use the shortcut {\tag ac method}. The shortcutwas using the numbers that split the middle term in the factors.  However, the previous example shows that the shortcut does not work when a =/= 1.

{ex}

	8x^2-2x-15		Multiply to a*c or (8)(-15) = -120, add to -2
   8x^2-12x+10x-15		The numbers are -12 and 10, split the middle term
  4x(2x-3)+5(2x-3)		Factor by grouping
      (2x-3)(4x+5)		Our solution

{\ex}

{ex}

       10x^2-27x+5		Multiply to a*c (10)(5)=50, add to -27
    10x^2-25x-2x+5		The numbers are -25 and -2, split the middle term
   5x(2x-5)-1(2x-5)		Factor by grouping
       (2x-5)(5x-1)		Our solution

We will now apply this to polynomials of two variables.

{ex}

       4x^2-xy-5y^2		Multiply to a*c=(4)(-5)=-20, add to -1
  4x^2+4xy-5xy-5y^2		The numbers are 4 and -5, split the middle term
    4x(x+y)-5y(x+y)		Factor by grouping
       (x+y)(4x-5y)

We should always see if we can factor out a GCF from all of theterms of the polynomial. It will make factoring the rest of the polynomial easier.

{ex}

	18x^3+33x^2+30x		GCF=3x, factor this out
        3x(6x^2+11x+10)		Multiply to a*c (6)(-10)=-60, add to 11
     3x(6x^2+15x-4x-10)		The numbers are 15 and -4, split the middle term
   3x(3x(2x+5)-2(2x+5))		Factor by grouping
	 3x(2x+5)(3x-2)		Our solution

{\ex}

{ex}

	   10x^2-27x+5		Multiply to a*c=(10)(5)=50, add to -27
	10x^2-25x-2x+5		The numbers are -25 and -2, split the middle term
      5x(2x-5)-1(2x-5)		Our solution

{\ex}

The same process applies to a polynomial of two variables.

{ex}

          4x^2-xy-5y^2		Multiply to a*c=(4)(-5)=-20, add to -1
     4x^2+4xy-5xy-5y^2		The numbers are 4 and -5, split the middle term
       4x(x+y)-5y(x+y)		Factor by grouping
          (x+y)(4x-5y)		Our solution

Similar to how some trinomials when a=1, not all trinomials can be factored. If there is no combination that multiply and add correctly then the polynomial is prime and cannot be factored.

{ex}

                3x^2+2x-7		Multiply to a*c=(3)(-7)=-21, add to 2
          -3(7) and -7(3)		Only two ways to factor -21; no combination adds to 2
Prime; cannot be factored		Our solution
