{5} FACTORING SPECIAL PRODUCTS

Overview: identify and factor special products including a difference of squares, perfect squares, and sum and difference of cubes.

When factoring we will notice there are a few special products, if we recognize them. 

Below is the difference of squares.

{\tag mod} Difference of squares: {\tag} a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)

{ex}

	x^2-16		Subtracting two perfect squares; square roots are x and 4
    (x+4)(x-4)		Our solution

{\ex}

{ex}

   9a^2-25b^2		Subtracting two perfect squares; square roots are 3a and 5b
(3a+5b)(3-5b)		Our solution

The sum of squares, however, cannot factor; it is alway prime. 

For example, x^2+36 using the ac method.

{ex}

x^2+36				0 is the middle term
x^2+0x+36			Mutiply to 36, add to 0
1*36, 2*18, 3*12, 4*9,6*6	No combination that multiplies to 36, adds to 0
Prime; cannot factor		Our solution

{\ex}

Sum of squares: a^2+b^2 = prime.

4th powers follow the same rule as squares, as they result in squares. For example:

{ex}

		a^4-b^4		Difference of squares with roots a^2 and b^2
     (a^2+b^2)(a^2-b^2)		The first factor is prime, second a is a difference of squares
    (a^2+b^2)(a+b)(a-b)		Our solution

{\ex}

{ex}

		x^4-16		Difference of squares with roots x^2 and 4
	(x^2+4)(x^2-4)		Continue factoring difference of squares; notice the prime binomial
     (x^2+4)(x+2)(x-2)		Our solution

{\ex}


Another factoring shortcut is the perfect square.

{\tag mod} Perfect square: {tag} a^2+2ab+b^2=(a+b)^2

Perfect squares can be difficult to recognize, but we can notice them using the ac method.

{ex}

		x^2-6x+9		Multiply to 9, add -6
					The numbers are -3 and -3, the same! Perfect square
		(x-3)^2			Use square roots from first and last terms and sign from middle

{\ex}

{ex}
	
	4x^2+20xy+25y^2			Multiply to 100, add to 20
					The numbers are 10 and 10, the same! Perfect square
	      (2x+5y)^2			Use square roots from first and last terms and sign from the middle

{\ex}

Next we have two factoring shortcuts involving cubes. There is a sum of cubes and a difference of cubes, and they are very similar.

{\tag mod} Sum of Cubes: {tag} a^3+b^3 = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)
{\tag mod} Difference of Cubes: {tag} a^3-b^3 = (a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)

You may use the word SOAP to think of the factoring formulas. S stands for the Same sign as the problem. O stands for the Opposite sign. AP stands for Always Positive. Both formulas end with addition. The example below shows factoring with cubes.

{ex}
	
	 m^3-27		We have cube roots m and 3
(m-3)(m^2+3m+9)		Our solution, using SOAP

{\ex}

{ex}

   	    125p^3+8r^3		We have cube roots 5p and 2r
(5p+2r)(25p^2-10r+4r^2)		Our solution, using SOAP

{\ex}

Often after factoring the sum or difference of cubes students try to factor the trinomial further.

As a general rule, this factor is prime, unless there is a GCF which should have been factored out before.

The following table summarizes the factoring of special products.

Difference of Squares		a^2-b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)
Sum of Squares			a^2+b^2 = Prime
Perfect Squares			a^2+2ab+b^2 = (a+b)^2
Sum of Cubes			a^3+b^3 = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)
Difference of Cubes		a^3-b^3 = (a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)

{ex}

		72x^2-2		GCF is 2
	     2(36x^2-1)		Difference of Squares, square roots are 6x and 1
	  2(6x+1)(6x-1)		Our solution

{\ex}

{ex}

         48x^2y-24xy+3y		GCF is 3y
	 3y(16x^2-8x+1)		Multiply to 16, add to 8
				The numbers are 4 and 4, the same!
	     3y(4x-1)^2		Our solution

{\ex}

{ex}

	     128a^4b^2+54ab^5		GCF is 2ab^2
           2ab^2(64a^3+27b^3)		Sum of cubes. Cube roots are 4a and 3b
2ab^2(4a+3b)(16a^2-12ab+9b^2)		Our solution
