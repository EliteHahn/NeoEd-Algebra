[Chapter 6] Factoring
[Section 5] Factoring Special Products

{tpc}[1][Factoring Special Products]
	In chapter 5, we learned about some {tag ..}special cases of expanding polynomials{\tag}. They were:
	$(a+b)(a-b) = a^2 - b^2$
	$(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$
	$(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$
	$(a+b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$
	$(a-b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b +3ab^2-b^3$

	Since factoring is just the reverse process of expanding, this means that we can reverse this process by factoring. In otherwords, if we have an expression that has the same form as the right side of the equation, it can be factored in the same way as it is on the left side of the equation.

	This examples may sometimes be harder to recognize. But there are a few strategies to figure out if you can use a special product. If your expression has cubed expressions(a cubed expression like $x^3$ or a cubed number like $2^3 = 8$), try out one of the two factoring methods involving cubes, $a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$ or $a^3 -3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3$.
	For {tag ..}trinomials{\tag}, if you see that the first and last terms are squares, see if you can try and fit it in the format $a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ or $a^2 - 2ab + b^2$. If you have two terms, and they are both squares, you can always factor using $a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b)$.

	Be careful, the sum of squares is not the same as the {tag ..}difference of squares{\tag}. In otherwords, at this point we cannot factor numbers of the form $a^2 + b^2$.

	Something to note, you can also factor expressions of the form $a^4 - b^4$ or $a^8-b^8$ or really any expression that is a {tag ..}difference of two numbers to an even power{\tag}. This is because $a^4$ is just $(a^2)^2$. Remember, that $a$ can be anything, even a squared variable. That means, that if you can write your number as a square (meaning basically anything to an even power), then it can fit the form $a^2 - b^2$.
	{exp}/*Throw in some examples with a^8, and etc*/{\exp}

	Sum of Cubes: $a^3+b^3 = (a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)$
	Difference of Cubes: $a^3-b^3 = (a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)$

	You may use the word SOAP to think of the factoring formulas. S stands for the Same sign as the problem. O stands for the Opposite sign. AP stands for Always Positive. Both formulas end with addition. The example below shows factoring with cubes.
