{tpc}[1][Zero Product Rule]
	Let's say we have two expressions, $a$ and $b$. These two expressions can have variables, they can be constants, they can be polynomial, virtually anything.
	Now if we have an equation $ab=0$, The Zero Product rule says that either $a$ or $b$ must evaluate to zero (or both).
	Why is this true? Well, we know that numbers can either be positive, negative, or 0. If $a$ and $b$ are either positive or negative, then as we know, when we multiply them together, we will get either a positive or negative number. Therefore, if our solution equals 0, then we know that either $a$ or $b$ must be 0, neither positive nor negative.
	This is important in algebra and all future math. Most immediately, the zero product rule is crucial when we learn how to {tag ..}solve quadratic equations by factoring{\tag}.

{tpc}[2][Solve Quadratic Equations by Factoring]
	When we were {tag ..}solving linear equations{\tag} such as 2x-5=21, we simply added 5 and divide by 2 to find $x$, getting 13. However, in a quadratic equation such as $x^2 - 5x + 6$, we cannot use this method to isolate $x$ as we did with the linear equation. One method to solve for an unknown variable is known as the {tag ..}zero product rule{\tag}.
	The {tag ..}zero product rule{\tag} states that when we have two expressions $a$ and $b$, and $ab = 0$, then either $a$ or $b$ (or both) must evaluate to zero. We can use this rule to solve equations, because after we factor something, we have two expressions multiplied to each other! For example, $x^2 - 5x + 6$ can be {tag ..}factored to{\tag} $(x-3)(x-2)$, where we have two expressions multiplied to each other, $(x-3)$ and $(x-2)$.
	By the zero product rule, we know that either $(x-3) = 0$ or $(x-2) = 0$. These of course individually are easy to solve, as they are just {tag ..}one step problems{\tag}. Also, notice we use the word "or", which means we can treat this as if we were solving an {tag ..}OR equation{\tag}.
	Solving for both these, we know that $x = 3$ or $x = 2$. This is our answer! $x=3$ or $x=2$.

	The steps to solving an equation in this way is simple.
	1. Get the equation to equal zero. Do this by {tag ..}adding or subtracting the opposite terms{\tag} to bring all elements from the right side to the left side.
	2. {tag ..}Factor{\tag}! If you can factor, this will allow us to move on to the next step. Make it so that you are multiplying two expressions together as you normally would when you factor.
	3. Using the {tag ..}Zero product rule{\tag}, note that one of the expressions must equal zero. Set each of the factors equal to zero and solve each of them individually. This will leave you with your final answer. Usually, there were will the same number of answers as there were factors, but the number of answers you can have may vary.

	Most of the time, problems with $x^2$ have two unique solutions; however, it is possible to have only one solution.

	Once more, it is important to factor out the {tag ..}greatest common factor{\tag} if we have one. Follow the rules on how to {tag ..}factor{\tag}, by making sure we factor out the GCF before factoring in other ways. This GCF is also a factor which we must take into account when using the zero product rule.

	Not all equations can be factored. For solving equations that cannot be factored, we will solve it using another method. Those other methods are saved for another section.
