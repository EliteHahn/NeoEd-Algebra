{tpc}[1][Solve by Factoring]
	Overview: solve quadratic equations by factoring and using the zero product rule.

	When we have linear equations such as 2x-5=21, we may simply add 5 and divide by 21 to find x, getting 13. However, with x^2, or x of a higher power, we cannot isolate x as we did with the linear equation. One method to solve for an unknown variable is known as the zero product rule.

	{tag ..} Zero Product Rule {\tag} if ab=0 then either a = 0 or b = 0

	Thus, if two factors are multiplied together and the answer is zero, then one of the factors must be zero.

	We will use this fact to solve factored polynomials as in the following example.

	{exp}

		(2x-3)(5x+1)=0		One factor must be zero
		2x-3=0 or 5x+1=0	Set each factor equal to zero
		+3+3	    -1-1	Solve each eqation
		2x=3	or 5x=-1
		/2	/5
		x=3/	x=\frac{-1}{5}	Our solution

	{\exp}

	Thus, for the zero product rule ot work, we need the {tag ..} factors {\tag} to be set equal to zero. Thus we must factor the problem if it is not already factored.

	{exp}
		4x^2+x-3=0		Factor using the {tag ..} ac method {\tag}, multiply to -12, add to 1
	  4x^2-3x+4x-3=0		The factors are -3 and 4, split the middle term
	  x(4x-3)+1(4x-3)=0		Factor by {tag ..} grouping {\tag}
		(4x-3)(x+1)=0		One factor must be zero
	  4x-3=0 or x+1=0		Set each factor equal to zero
	  +3+3     -1-1		Solve each equation
	  4x=3  or x=-1
	  /4     /-1
		x=\frac{4}{3} or x=-1		Our solution
	{\exp}

	It is important to note that we must have the equation equal to zero. If it does not, then we must move terms around so that it does.

	{exp}
		x^2=8x-15		Set equal to zero by moving terms to the left
		-8x+15 -8x+15
		x^2-8x+15=0		Factor using the ac method, multiplying by 15, add to -8
		(x-5)(x-3)=0		The numbers are -5 and 03
		x-5=0 or x-3=0		Zero product rule
	 	+5+5     +3+3		Solve each equation
		x=5   or x=3		Our solution
	{\exp}

	{exp}
		(x-7)(x+3)=-9		Not equal to zero, multiply first, use FOIL
	  x^2-7x+3x-21=-9		Combine like terms
	  x^2-4x-21=-9		Move -9 to other side so equation equals zero
	  +9  +9
	  x^2-4x-12=0		Factor using {tag ..} ac method {\tag}. Multiply to -12, add to -4
		(x-6)(x+2)=0		The numbers are 6 and -2
	  x-6=0 or x+2=0		Set equal to zero
		+6+6     -2-2		Solve each equation
		x=6  or -2		Our solution
	{\exp}

	{exp}
		3x^2+4x-5=7x^2+4x-14		Set equation equal to zero, move terms to the right
		-3x^2-4x+5  -3x^2-4x+5
		0=4x^2-9		Factor using difference of squares
		0=(2x+3)(2x-3)		One factor must be zero
	  2x+3=0 or 2x-3=0		Set each factor equal to zero
		-3-3      +3+3		Solve each equation
		2x=-3 or  2x=3
		x=\frac{-3}{2} or \frac{3}{2}	Our solution
	{\exp}

	Most of the time, problems with x^2 have two unique solutions; however, it is possible to have only one solution.

	{exp}
		4x^2=12x-9		Set equal to zero, move terms to the left
	  -12x+9 -12x+9
	  4x^2-12x+9=0		Factor using the ac method, multiply to 36, add to -12
		(2x-3)^2=0		-6 and -6, a perfect square!
		2x-3=0		Set this factor equal to zero
		+3+3		Solve equation
		2x=3
	  x = \frac{3}{2}		Our solution
	{\exp}

	Once more, it is important to factour out the {tag ..} GCF {\tag} if we have one. This GCF is also a factor which we must take into account when using the zero product rule.

	{exp}
		4x^2=8x		Set equal to zero by moving the terms to left
	  -8x-8x		Be caerful! They are not like terms!
		4x^2-8x=0		Factor out GCF, 4x
		4x(x-2)=0		Zero product rule
		4x=0 or x-2=0		Set each factor equal to zero
		/4 /4    +2+2		Solve each equation
		x=0 or x=2		Our solution
	{\exp}

	{exp}
		2x^3-14x^2+24x=0	Factor out GCF of 2x
		2x(x^2-7x+24)=0	Factor using {tag ..} ac method {\tag}. Multiply to 12, add to -7
		2x(x-3)(x-4)=0	The numbesr are -3 and -4
	  2x=0 or x-3=0 or x-4=0	Set each factor equal to zero
	  /2/2     +3+3     +4+4	Solve each equation
		x=0 or 3 or 4		Our solutions
	{\exp}

	{exp}
		6x^2+21x-27=0	Factor out GCF of 3
	  3(2x^2+7x-9)=0	Factor with ac method, multiply to -18, add to 7
		3(2x^2+9x-2x+9)=0	The numbers are 9 and -2
	  3(x(2x+9)-1(2x+9))=0	Factor by grouping
		3(2x+9)(x-1)=0	One factor must be zero
	  3=0 or 2x+9=0 or x-1=0	Set each factor equal to zero
		3 =/= 0    -9-9     +1+1
		2x=9	or x=1
		/2/2
	  x = \frac{9}{2} or x=1	Our solution
	{\exp}

	Not all equations can be factored. For solving equations that cannot be factored, we will solve it using another method. Those other methods are saved for another section.
