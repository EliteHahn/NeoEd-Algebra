{2} GROUPING

Overview: factor polynomials with four terms using grouping. 

As shown in the previous section, the first thing we do when factoring is try to identify the GCF and then factor it out {\tag factoring} {\tag GCF}. The GCF in the previous examples was a monomial, such as for 5xy+10xz, the GCF is the monomial 5x, so that we have 5x(y+2z). However, the GCF could also be a binomial. Here are two examples which illustrate:

{ex}

	3ax-7bx		Both have x in common. Factor it out.
	x(3a-7b)	Our solution.

{\ex}

Now, let us use the same problem with (2a+5b) instead of x:

{ex}

	3a(2a+5b)-7b(2a+5b)	Both have (2a+5b) in common. Factor it out.
	(2a+5b)(3a-7b)		Our solution.

{\ex}

The (2a+5b) can be factored out just like the x can. This can be extended to factor polynomials where there is no GCF to factor out, or after the GCF if factored out, there is more factoring to be done. We will now use another strategy to factor. This strategy is called grouping.

{ex}

	(2a+3)(5b+2)		Distribute (2a+3) into second parenthesis.
	5b(2a+3)+2(2a+3)	Distribute each monomial.
	10ab+15b+4a+6		Our solution.

{\ex}

Notice the four terms in the solution. While factoring by grouping we will divide the problem into two parts, the first and the last two terms. Then factor the GCF out of both the left and the right sides. If they match, we can pull the GCF out front, leaving the rest of the terms in the parenthesis.

The following example is the same problem worked backwards:

{ex}

10ab+15b+4a+6		Split into two groups
(10ab+15b)+(4a+6)	GCF on left is 5b, on the right is 2
5b(2a+3)+2(2a+3)	(2a+3) is the same. Factor out this GCF.
(2a+3)(5b+2)		Our solution

{\ex}

For grouping to work, after the GCF is factored out of the left and the right, the two binomials must match exactly. If there is any difference, we will need to adjust, or, it cannot be factored by grouping. An example below illustrates:

{ex}

6x^2+9xy-14x-21y	Split problem into two groups
6x^2+9xy|-14x-21y	GCF on left is 3x, on right is 7
3x(2x+37)|+7(-2x-3y)	The signs in the parenthesis do not match!

{\ex}

When the signs do not match, but everything else is the same, we may factor the opposite of the GCF on the right side: we will use -7 instead of 7. 

{ex}

3x(2x+3y)|-7(2x+3)	(2x+3y) is the same. Factor out this GCF.
(2x+3y)(3x-7)		Our solution

{\ex}

If the first term of the first binomial is negative, then will use the opposite of the GCF to be sure that they match. If the first term of the first binomial is positive, we will want the first term of the second binomial to also be positive. 

{ex}

5xy-8x-10y+16		Split the problem into two groups
5xy-8x | -10y+16	GCF on left is x, on right we need the variable a to be negative. Thus, we use -2 instead of 2.
x(5y-8) | -2(5y-8)	(5y-8) is the same! Factor out this GCF.
(5y-8)(x-2)		Our solution.

{\ex}

Sometimes there is no GCF to factor out of the left or right sides. In this case we will use a GCF of either 1 or -1. This is what we will need to ensure that the two binomials match.

{ex}

12ab-14a-6b+7		Split the problem into two groups.
12ab-14a | -6b+7	GCF on the left is 2a, on the right, there is no GCF: use -1
2a(6b-7)-1(6b-7)	(6b-7) is the same! Factor out this GCF
(6b-7)(2a-1)

{\ex}

{ex}

6x^3-14a-6b+7		Split the problem into two groups
6x^3-15x^2 | + 2x-5	GCF on left is 3x^2, on right, no GCF: use 1
3x^2(2x-5) | + 1(2x-5)	(2x-5) is the same! Factor out this GCF
(2x-5)(3x^2+1)		Our solution

{\ex}

Another problem that may come up is that the factored binomials differ by more than just the sign. We may have to adjust the problem slightly. We may do this by changing the order of the terms and try again.

{ex}

4a^2-21b^3+6ab-14ab^2		Split the problem into two groups
4a^2-21b^3 | +6ab-14ab^2	GCF on left is 1, on right is 2ab
1(4a^2-21b^3) | +2ab(3-7b)	Binomials don't match. Change order of terms.
4a^2+6ab-14ab^2-21b^3		Split problem into two groups
4a^2+6ab | -14ab^2-21b^3	GCF on left is 2a, on right is -7b^2
2a(2a+3b) | -7b^2(2a+3b)	(2a+3b) is the same! Factor this GCF out
(2a+3b)(2a-7b^2)		Our solution

{\ex}

For addition, for example, (a+b) and (b+a), order does not matter so we do not have to do any extra work. This is because addition is the same in either order (5+3=3+5=8).

{ex}

		7+y-3xy-21x		Split problem into two groups
	    7+ y | -3xy-21x		GCF on left is 1, on right is -3x
	 1(7+y)|-3x(y+7)		y+7 and 7+y are the same, use either
	    (y+7)(1-3x)			Our solution

{\ex}

If the binomial uses subtraction, then we need to be more careful, such as with (a-b) and (b-a). We will factor our the opposite of the GCF on one part, usually the second. 

{ex}

		(b-a)	Factor out -1
    	     -1(-b+a)	Addition can be in either order, switch order
	      -1(a-b)	The order of the subtraction has been switched

{\ex}

We won't show all of the above steps, we just simply factor out the opposite of the GCF and switch the order of the subtraction.

{ex}

8xy-12y+15-10x		Split the problem into two groups
8xy-12y | 15-10x	GCF on left is 4y, on right 5
4y(2y-3) | +5(3-2x)	Need to switch subtraction order, use -5 in middle
4y(2x-3) | -5(2x-3)	Now (2x-3) matches on both sides. Factor out this GCF
(2x-3)(4y-5)		Our solution

{\ex}
