Overview: identify and use the correct method to factor various polynomials.

With so many different factoring tools, it sometimes becomes hard to know when to apply them.

We will work through the strategies for factoring.

First, we will always try to factor the GCF first.

{\tag mod} GCF First {tag}

2 terms: {\tag mod} sum {tag} or {\tag mod} difference of squares {tag}:

	a^2-b^2=(a+b)(a-b)
	a^2+b^2=Prime
	a^3+b^3=(a+b)(a^2-ab+b^2)
	a^3-b^3=(a-b)(a^2+ab+b^2)

3 terms: {\tag mod} ac method {tag}, watch for perfect square!

	a^2+2ab+b^2=(a+b)^2
	Multiply to a*c and add to b

4 terms: {\tag mod} grouping {tag}


{ex}

		4x^2+5xy+196y^2			GCF first, 4
	       4(x^2+14y+49y^2)			Three terms, try ac method, multiply to 49, add to 14
						7 and 7, perfect square!
		      4(x+7y)^2			Our solution

{ex}

	  5x^2y+15xy-35x^2-105x			GCF first, 5x
	        5x(xy+3y-7x-21)			Four terms, try grouping
	      5x(y(x+3)-7(x+3))			(x+3) match
	           5x(x+3)(y-7)			Our solution

{ex}

		     100x^2-400			GCF first, 100
	             100(x^2-4)			Two terms, difference of squares
		  100(x+4)(x-4)			Our solution

	108x^3y^2-39x^2y^2+3xy^2		GCF first, 3xy^2
	      3xy^2(36x^2-13x+1)		Three terms, ac method: factor 36, add to -13
	    3xy^2(36x^2-9x-4x+1)		-9 and -4, split middle term
	 3xy^2(9x(4x-1)-1(4x-1))		Factoring by grouping
	       3xy^2(4x-1)(9x-1)		Our solution

	   		5+625y^3		GCF first, 5
		     5(1+125y^3)		Two terms, sum of cubes
	     5(1+5y)(1-5y+25y^2)		Our solution
