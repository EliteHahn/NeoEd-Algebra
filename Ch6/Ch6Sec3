[Chapter 6] Factoring
[Section 3] Trinomials of the Form $x^2 + bx + c$

{tpc}[1][Factoring Trinomials where the Coefficient of $x^2$ is 1]
	Factoring {tag ..}trinomials{\tag}, polynomials with three terms, is the most common type of factoring. Since {tag ..}factoring{\tag} is essentially undoing a multiplication, we will start with a multiplication problem and look at how we can reverse this process.

	{exp}
		$(x+6)(x-4)$		Distribute $(x+6)$ through second parenthesis
		$x(x+6)-4(x+6)$		Distribute each monomial through parenthesis
		$x^2+6x-4x-24$
	{\exp}

	Of course usually, when we reach the last step, we will need to {tag ..}combine like terms{\tag}, to get $x^2 + 2x - 24$. However, if you were to reverse the three steps we just showed above, it would look exactly like {tag ..}factoring by grouping{\tag}. You could group the first two terms, $x^2+6x$ as well as the second two terms $-4x - 24$ and factor them individually ($x(x+6) - 4(x+6)$) and then factor out the $(x+6)$ to get our original expression, $(x+6)(x-4)$. So in a way, we can factor $x^2 + 2x - 24$ as long as we know we can rewrite this as $x^2 + 6x - 4x - 24$.
	So if we have an expression of the form $x^2 + bx + c$, sometimes, there might be a way to split the middle term to {tag ..}factor by grouping{\tag}. So how do we know when we can do this? And how do we know how to split it? After all, there are multiply ways to rewrite $2x$, such as $6x-4x$ (the way that worked), but it can also be $5x-3x$, $7x-5x$, $x+ x$, $-x + 3x$, and an infinite amount of other ways.

	To answer this, let's look back at our original expression $(x+6)(x-4)$. Notice when we expanded this (before {tag ..}simplifying{\tag} and {tag ..}combining like terms{\tag}), we got $x\cdot x + 6x - 4x - 6 \cdot 4$. Notice, how the middle two terms have coefficients of 6 and 4, and the last term multiplies 6 and 4. So when combining the middle two terms, we have to combine through subtracting, 6 and 4, and the last term we have to multiply 6 and 4. Also notice that in our original expression, we use the numbers 6 and 4 in $(x+6)(x-4)$. This is not a coincidence!
	Let's say we want to use {tag ..}FOIL{\tag} or distribution to expand the expression $(x+n)(x+m)$. We would end up with $x^2 + nx + mx + nm$, or after {tag ..}combining like terms{\tag}, $x^2 +(m + n)x + nm$. Notice that for our last term, $n$ and $m$ are being multiplied together, and for our middle term, $n$ and $m$ are being added together. Using this fact, we can reverse the process on factor certain polynomials.

	If we have an expression $x^2 + 7x + 6$, we know that if we can factor this number into the form $(x+n)(x+m)$, we know that $m$ and $n$ must multiply to get us 6 (the last term) and $m$ and $n$ must add to get us $7$ (the middle term). In other words, we must find $m$ and $n$ so that $m \times n = 6$ and $m + n = 7$. There is a simple process to figure out what $m$ and $n$ are:
	1. First, let's find what numbers multiply to the last term, the number 6. We have $1$ and $6$, 2 and 3, but we also have $-1$ and $-6$ as well as $-2$ and $-3$. Since these are all the {tag ..}factor pairs{\tag} of 6, we know that our values for $m$ and $n$ must be one of these 4 choices.
	2. Of these choices, find which pair adds up to the middle term, 7. $2+3 = 5$, so that doesn't work. $(-1) + (-6) = -7$, which doesn't work and $(-2) + (-3) = -5$ which again doesn't work. However, our first choice, $1$ and $6$ add up to 7! ($1 + 6 = 7$). That means, we know our $m$ and $n$ values are 1 and 6!
	3. Now we can factor. {tag ..}Plug in our values{\tag} for $m$ and $n$ in the expression $(x+m)(x+n)$, which will gives us $(x+1)(x+6)$. Remember, because of the communitive property, $(x+6)(x+1)$ is also a correct answer.

	It is also very important to keep track of signs. Take for example, $x^2 - 7x + 12$. In this case, we want to find values for $m$ and $n$ in $(x+m)(x+n)$ so that $m$ and $n$ multiply to 12, but add up to $-7$ (notice the {tag ..}negative sign{\tag}, just like in our polynomial). Keeping track of these signs is important, because our final factored answer will be affected by negative numbers.
	Let's list out the numbers that multiply out to 12, using the same steps as above. $1$ and 12, 2 and 6, 3 and 4, but also their negative counterparts, $-1$ and $-12$, $-2$ and $-6$, $-3$ and $-4$. Our second step tells us to find which of these numbers add up to $-7$. The only pair of numbers that does this is $-3$ and $-4$. Plugging this back into our factored form, we get $(x + (-3))(x + (-4))$. Of course, because the {tag ..}negative sign{\tag} is the same as subtracting, we write this as $(x-3)(x-4)$. Keeping track of negative signs is very important when doing these types of equations

	Sometimes a polynomial cannot be factored. If there is no combination of numbers that multiplies and adds to the correct numbers, then the polynomial cannot be factored. Similar to how prime numbers cannot be factored, we say that the polynomial is prime.

	Be sure to only use this method when factoring trinomials of the form $x^2 + bx + c$! If the {tag ..}coefficient{\tag} of $x^2$ is not 1, then this method will not work.
