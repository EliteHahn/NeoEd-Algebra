# NeoEd-Algebra
Open source textbook: Beginning and Intermediate Algebra Textbook by Tyler Wallace, optimized for the Neo Education Project

NeoEducation was founded on the belief that there were still fundamental improvements to be made to ease the educational process for all students. Improvements, that could be made with few resources and much student feedback. NeoEducation hopes to be the stepping stone for educational software indended for the sole purpose of assisting STUDENTS in their learning, without adhering to the many limitations of systemized education. 

NeoEd-Algebra is currently in the process of rewriting math curiculum using our own typeset for the purposes of it being compatible with our educational software. The typeset was designed specifically so that it would be easy to read and modify, while also having the functionality we believe every educational tool needs.
